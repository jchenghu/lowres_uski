What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination . We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about . And the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are .

Ed : Hello , everyone . Good evening . I 'd like to welcome you to the - ( laughter ) The MlT Club of California . Tonight , we have an excellent , distinguished speaker , but before we introduce him , I hope you have enjoyed the sandwiches and cookies . We learned to make those ourselves by watching one of Sal 's videos . ( laughter ) Just kidding , they 're from Subway . ( laughter ) Let me read a bio for Sal . Sal is a social entrepreneur who has become an internet sensation and inspiration for his fun and highly effective educational videos on YouTube . Every month , more than 100, 000 students , both young and old , across the globe , use his over 1, 300 free videos to learn about arithmetics , finance , chemistry , ( unintelligible ) calculus . He founded the Khan Academy , which was recently covered on CNN , PBS News , NPR , San Francisco Chronicle , and NBC Nightline . His mission is nothing short of creating a free and world class virtual school for anyone in the world . He will speak about his experience starting the academy and massively transformational changes in learning and teaching . ( unintelligible ) in the next five to ten years . Sal graduated from MlT in 1998 with computer science and math degrees and received his MBA from Harvard Business School . He left his day job as a hedge fund analyst in 2009 to dedicated full time to his non- profit academy . We 're delighted and honored to have this distinguished speaker tonight , an emerging giant in the online education space , a world- class educator , a dynamic communicator , and a selfless good- doer , Salman Khan . ( applause ) Sal : Can you all hear me ? I 'd prefer to just be closer to you all , than ... Can you hear me in the back ? Okay , cool . Just like Ed said , I 'm Sal , the founder and faculty of the Khan Academy . ( laughter ) This is - I really want to make this - I think this will be a fun conversation . I don 't want this to be me at the PowerPoint for the whole hour . I really want you all to interrupt me or raise your hand , ask me questions , and we can take this wherever we want to go , because there 's really a couple of different conversations we can have and maybe we can have them all . How many of you all have watched a Khan Academy video ? Okay , that 's a pretty good cover . Just so you know what it is , and actually , maybe to get a sense , of the growth . Ed said 100, 000 and when he first asked me it was 100, 000 , now it 's 200, 000 unique students a month and it 's only been two months . It is the fastest growing open course effort . Now , it 's actually passed up - I 'm not - Well , I 'm a little competitive . It passed up MlT recently , in terms of ( laughter ) being the most used . It 's getting about 60 or 70, 000 video views a day . It has closed to 16 million views on YouTube . One of the things we can talk about is maybe why . It might be something about the content , how it 's delivered and whatnot . We can talk about all of that . This is the site , just for those of you all who have never seen it . We can also debate my user interface skills for just putting all 1, 400 links ( laughter ) on one page . Those are the videos and if you click on a random video , if you want a review of ( unintelligible ) you can click there . We can let it load up or whatever . That 's the Khan Academy . What I want to do - ( unintelligible ) Is there sound ? The sound isn 't any different than what you 're hearing right now . ( laughter ) You see this and you hear my voice and you don 't see me . This 'll give you a flavor for the form factor . That could be a conversation we could have about why this is an interesting form factor and why I did it and all of that type of thing . What I 'm going to focus on , because I think most people are familiar with the video library . It has this reach , it 's gotten popular , it 's growing 10 or 15 % a month at this point . I want to talk about the bigger vision . Ed has talked about this idea of starting a virtual school for the world and obviously , videos are a start . They 're the lecture part of a school , but a real school 's got to be more than just video . You have to have some interaction with other people , you have to have practice , you have to have assessment , you have to have data and all of these things . That 's what I want to talk about and I 'm generally open to ideas , because this is a work in progress . Some of it is starting to be built . Hopefully over the next few months it 'll be built in a much bigger way . Some volunteers have come out of the woodwork very recently to supercharge some of these efforts . It 's exciting times . Let me get the presentation up . A good number of you all saw the videos . How many of you all saw the web application on the site ? Okay , that 's a much lower penetration rate . Just so you all know a little bit of the history , and I 'm happy to go into this as much as you want , but I started doing this remotely tutoring , because I was in Boston , my cousins were in New Orleans , and she was having trouble with units and I said , " Hey , after your school and my work let 's get together virtually . " We 'll use Yahoo Doodle , it 'll be a shared notepad " that we can each see what each other is writing . " I got her a little Wacom pen tablet , I had one for myself . We 'd just do conference calls and that 's how I started . Then she started doing really well , then I started tutoring her brothers , other cousins . Then a couple of things happened and I usually go straight to the videos , because that 's what it 's known for , but being a computer science geek , I didn 't even think of doing the videos at first . I said , " Hey , you know what , I 'm going to write soft - I would give them these little lectures and I would just point them to random websites , like , " Hey , there 's a cool applet on that website over there . " Why don 't you try it out and tell me tomorrow whether you understood , " whether you 're able to do those exercises , or use that website over there , " I just got really frustrated , this piecemeal website here , website there , so I said , " I 'm going to write a couple of javascript , " little things that 'll generate problems for them . " It 's not just ten problems and it may come up with some random numbers and give them as many problems as they need . I made a bunch of these modules . I 'll show you what the modules look like . This is like a multiplying decimals module and we can go into as much depth on these as you want . I started making these little javascript modules for them and it was starting really where she was , at units and basic algebra and adding and subtracting negative numbers , and basic linear equations and then I said , " Gee , you know , I don 't trust - I 'd say , " Hey , Nadia , did you do the problems ? " How many did you do ? " and she 's like , " Oh yeah , I did them ( unintelligible ) ( laughter ) I was like , " I 'm going to put a database behind this thing . " I put a database behind it so I could keep track of when she did the problem , how long was it taking her , how many times was she doing , how frequently was she getting one right or one wrong . Then I started making them up . On that first slide right there , each of these circles is a module , and literally , the first module - This was a very organic process . It was really just me working with my cousins and iterating , saying it would be nice to have the data . Then , I started making modules here one off and I would at first just point them to it . Then after a while , I was like , there 's some kind of dependency here , because Nadia got that , but she needs help with that , so to fill in that gap , let me make another module . Then , after a while , I got tired of having to assign the modules , so I said , " Well , it should automatically assign the modules , " because once she gets ten in a row in this , " she 's ready for this , this , and this . " So , I created this internal dependency in the little app to do this and I said , " Well , this is kind of a neat graph . " This is what I was using just to keep track of the modules , I should just expose this to the students , so they know what 's going on . This is the app and this started well before I made the first video , but it 's kind of like the secret of the Khan Academy , so you 're getting a little tidbit . But I think it 's also the future on a lot of levels . So this right here , this is literally level one addition , so it 's literally 1+1 . If you go to the website , there is literally a video on 1+1 and at first , it 's almost a joke that I made the video on adding 1+1 , but the whole idea behind it , besides being cute , is to give people the notion that no matter how basic your skills , you can go to this site and you will find something that fits your need and the idea that you can , when you see 1+1 on the same page as vector calculus , you 're like , " Gee , I just have to step through that thing and I can get to vector calculus . " There 's not some mysterious - ( laughter ) " And it 's the same dude who 's going to take me through the - ( laughter ) " My Kindergarten teacher is teaching me vector calculus . " ( laughter ) You get ten in a row and - Once this was made , then it started to make - This became what a lot of people in education talk about , differentiated learning , with data and all of that , but it made me pause and say , " This is working for my cousins , " but there was actually one piece that was missing and that was the - I still had to do - When I first started it , I thought - It randomly generated these problems and picked random numbers here and then when you clicked hint , it would show you the exact steps for that problem . I was like , " Oh , that 's all you need to learn how to do a problem . " You just need the exact steps for that exact problem . " This 'll work for my cousins . " But it didn 't . It would help them if they kind of knew how to multiply decimals already , but it didn 't get them over that hurdle . I still had to do that one- on- one session with them remotely . That became hard to scale . Literally , another buddy from MlT , we were at dinner and he 's like , " Why don 't you make YouTube videos ? " The thing that you do with your cousins , " why don 't you just record that on YouTube ? " I was completely dismissive of the idea . I was like , " Oh , that 's so silly , I have this software . " It generates problems dynamically , ( laughter ) " it 's got hints , what 's a YouTube video going to do ? " He 's like , " Yeah , you 're right , it 's probably a stupid idea . " ( laughter ) I went home and I was like , " Well , maybe there 's something to it . " Literally , when I kept recording videos with my cousins , I would do the tenth lecture on negative numbers with a new cousin , I was like , " Yeah , maybe a YouTube video will make sense . " I made the first YouTube video on greatest common divisor and this and that and then - I 've said this in talks before , the immediate feedback I got from my cousins was that , " You are better on YouTube than you are live . " ( laughter ) The point , I think , that he was trying to communicate is it had none of the pressure of a traditional tutoring session . " Did you get this ? " and you 're staring at the person . They 're like , " Yeah , maybe I did , " ( laughter ) and they 're giving you bad information , because they didn 't get it . They feel bad pausing or repeating me , but they can do it all they want with a YouTube video , or they can go to Wikipedia , or they might be afraid of even admitting that they don 't know how to borrow or regroup or whatever , but now they can actually review it in these one off videos . Then other people started watching it , as well , and said , " Hey , there 's something there , " and on top of that , I incorporated with this , because that was the whole point in the first place , to have if you 've never seen this concept before , you at least have this outlet , these YouTube videos that you could somehow access , but before I go into the depths of this , I want to - Once this was built , then I had this , " This seems to be working , " but let 's compare it to what goes on right now in the school system . " If you think , the whole conversation about education right now , it 's all about the student- teacher ratios , how can we make the inner city , poor schools look a lot like the fancy , rich schools , give people computers , but no one is fundamentally questioning the model . If you really think about the model itself , I don 't want to taint your opinion before - It 's bizarre . You have this situation , you go to the classroom and you 're all in a room together - We 'll talk about what you could do if you 're all in a room together , but there 's no interaction . It 's just this broadcast lecture , especially once you get to the university level , but even in the classroom in middle school . There might be a little one question here or there , but fundamentally , it 's a broadcast lecture to the room . The teacher is pretty much guaranteed to lose half the students , or bore half the students , and at some point , they 're going to switch the whole time . You do that , then the student has to go home , do their homework . They do it in a complete vacuum . They have a textbook , every other problem there 's a solution in the back , you don 't know why you got it right or wrong , anything . You don 't have anyone to help you . If you 're lucky you might get a tutor or a parent might be able to help you . Then you go to the class the next day and there might be some type of review of homework or something , but really no real feedback and the cycle repeats itself . You get another lecture , then you go back home , you do homework in a vacuum , and this whole time you don 't know what you 're doing at all . The teacher has no data , nothing . That occurs for a couple of days and then , bam , you have an assessment . The assessment , some students get 50 % , 80 % , 70 % , 90 % . The good students get 95 % , next concept . Even if you fail an exam , the class moves on . You don 't know half of the subject , half of the material in that previous concept and the class is going to move on . You might say that failing student 's bad and the A students are all right , but they still didn 't know 5 % of the concept . Maybe it was a careless mistake , but maybe they didn 't know what happens when you take something to the zeroth power . Maybe they didn 't know exactly what a fractional exponent was , that one problem on the exam with the fractional exponent . That A student , the one who 's getting the positive label , when they go to calculus and they see that , what are they going to do ? They 're not going to get 95 % , they 're going to get 90 % , because they 're going to miss that and another concept . That 's not even to mention about the 50 % . You have this bizarre - The first time you get assessment is when it 's time to move to the next concept . In no way is it actionable . If you really think about the process , it 's just this huge filtering mechanism . It 's just this process where every step of the way we 're just knocking more and more people off and the lucky people in this room , we were the people who happened to be lucky enough that we were assessed and filtered at the right place at the right time and that led to us feeling really smart and going on . ( laughter ) That 's the way it works . It makes you really question - We 're all lucky . ( laughter ) That 's the big takeaway . What 's happening here , what I think is happening here , is that whole cycle , it 's all happening instantaneously with every interaction . The instruction , if you 've never seen multiplying decimals before in your life , you click " watch video " , it pumps in from YouTube , and you can imagine there 's one or two videos right now , but you eventually have ten videos , you 're tracking whether the person watched the video , you can eventually track whether they paused or repeated , where they watched , and I 'll talk more about that later on , how you can perfect the content . They get the instruction there , then they can do the practice , so you 're giving them practice and you get immediate feedback . Did I get it right or wrong ? If you don 't know how to do it , you get the exact steps for that problem and then you 're also getting assessment , because every time you do a problem , it 's tracking everything about that . When you did it , how long it took you , how many times did you click " hint " , and then the paradigm here , and I literally did this just on a whim , I was just like , " How do I know if someone really knows something ? " It 's not 90 % , or it 's not 95 % , just keep doing it until you get ten in a row . Ten in a row should be the paradigm , because then that will enforce a certain level of discipline . People say , " Oh isn 't that - No , when you take the SAT , you can 't make those little careless mistakes . You should enforce a certain level of precision . I just threw out ten in a row . It doesn 't have to be ten in a row , it could be five in a row , or whatever , depending on the concept , but if you think about what 's happening when you enforce it is you don 't allow that 95 % student to move on while not knowing that 5 % and then only get lost in the next topic . That 's the general idea . This right here is the - This is just another example of a module . This is slope of a line . If you don 't know how to do , just do " hint " and it draws things for you . It 's just another indication of - All of this is live . You can go right now to KhanExercises . appspot . com and you can try out all of this stuff and I encourage you if you have friends or family members . There was even a guy at the hedge fund I worked with who was going to take the GMAT and he was summa cum laude from Yale and he 's like , " What should I use for math ? " " You should use this . " He was like , " Hey , but this is starting me at 1+1 . " I said , " Just do it . " Two weeks later , he was like , " That was good . " ( laughter ) It 's amazing how long many people haven 't multiplied decimals . ( laughter ) That 's the self- paced student view of the world . I still haven 't given you the whole virtual school . Right now we 're talking about videos and then we 've kind of automated the self- directed learning and learning at your own pace and getting assessed , but then you have to think about how can you incorporate that with the human experience . You 're coming into a room together to essentially learn how can you use this technology to hyper charge that ? Actually , before I even talk about this , there 's actually a very simple flipping of the classroom that I think should occur tomorrow . You don 't need any of this software , because the videos already exist and some teachers - It wasn 't my idea - A teacher in London said that he is now - If you think , it 's actually a no- brainer . I don 't understand why this doesn 't happen worldwide tomorrow . He is now assigning the lectures for homework and he 's having the students do homework in the classroom . There 's no other technology necessary . Think about what happens there . Right now , we all gather at seven in the morning in 10250 and we 're all with our peers and ( unintelligible ) We have to sit passively and just get this broadcast lecture and then we go off on our own and we do these problem sets in a vacuum . If you flip the model and the lecture , as we said , is one size fits all , I might be lost or bored , I might have gaps from the last lecture that I didn 't understand , but I still have to get this exact lecture . You flip the model , you get on- demand video at home , when you 're ready for it , when you 're awake . I got a letter from a student about they did actually have a good calculus teacher , but he had two rows in front of him this really cute girl and every day he 's just trying to figure out how he can ask her out and he missed two months of calculus . ( laughter ) This was his only - ( laughter ) I say that 's a story of another person , but - ( laughter ) We all had similar stories . ( laughter ) We go home and we do these problem sets in a complete vacuum . We have no one to help us , but if you flip it , you can watch things at your own pace , fill in your gaps , do whatever you need and then when you 're in the classroom , you have 30 or 40 or 400 of your peers to help you and you have the professor who can walk around and in real time , see how people are doing , two weeks before the assessment , two weeks before everyone gets that label placed on their head that they 're a B student . If you really think about it , honestly , and I 'm not this touchy - These people who are anti- grades and that 's like , oh , that 's touchy feely . I 'm anti- grades because I think it 's ridiculous . It 's not about - It 's because if you 're a B student , you shouldn 't - Everyone should be forced to be an A student . It 's on that concept . It 's silly , you 'll meet many , many people , and I think this room is an exception , but you 'll meet many , many people who went through algebra , algebra two , geometry , pre- calculus , trigonometry , calculus , and when they see an algebra problem in front of their face , they don 't see it . They have never had mastery of anything in between and this whole exercise of going from one hoop to the next and being an A - student the whole way , it 's just an exercise in filtering , it 's not an exercise in actually making people have tangible skills that they can do something productive with . What I just described , flipping the model , that 's if you have no technology , but if you have the technology , what you can do is teach - There 's a bunch of student names here that you can 't see , I 've blanked them out , but this is a report that a teacher could have and this is actually a real report , this isn 't a Photoshop version . This was at a summer camp where they used what I showed you in the last couple slides as their math curriculum , where every student was able to work at their own pace and the teacher walks in every day . Each column here is one of those modules that we saw on that first slide , one of those concepts . Each row here is a student . Green means the student already got ten in a row on that concept . They did it , they 're cool . Purple means that they 're working on it right now , that that 's their frontier of learning at the moment . Everything seems to be going okay . Red means that students done 50 problems . Sometimes you can think of the heuristic . That student 's done 50 problems , 95 % of students who have done 50 problems in that module usually move on . This student has not . Some type of intervention should occur , some type of human intervention . A teacher could look at this and either they could eyeball it . They could say , " Hey , look , everyone 's doing fine " but these two kids need help in level two division . " Let everyone else work at their own pace , " let me just take these two students aside " and do a very intimate , focused intervention " on just those two students . " Even better , you can pair these two students up with these two students initially and see if that gets them over the hurdle . You can actually capture the data before and after that . I 'm not there yet , but if the software is actually scheduling the interactions , you can actually see what happens before those and start to rank teachers and students and all of that type of thing . Slowly work up to the level of the teacher . What I think should happen and hope that this catalyzes it is we go back to a one- room schoolhouse . We go back to room full of people , from Kindergartners all the way to anybody . Senior citizens who want to come back and learn and they 're all working at their own pace and if you have trouble with a concept , even if you don 't know , this will know if you having trouble with a concept . It will pair you with somebody else and it 'll know about that interaction , it 'll know how good of an instructor that person was before and after , you 'll rate them , whatever else . Then , you can keep escalating up and up the ladder until eventually you can get by the paid teacher . You can actually have a reality where - Obviously there 's a huge aspect of actually teaching people for retention . This isn 't just a way to get economics and scale . This whole mechanism , I 'm a ninth grader and I 'm teaching a sixth grader negative numbers . That , by itself , is a hugely powerful tool . I 'm learning things better than I ever learned before just doing these videos . You can imagine if you 're - And this whole level of maturity . I think , actually , if you hang out with people older and younger than yourself , you actually act more mature for a whole set of reasons . Then , all of a sudden , you have a model , where everyone is learning , the classroom is actually an interactive experience , it 's no longer a passive experience , everyone is operating exactly at the level that they need to , and it actually scales . You can actually make it economic . You could actually have - Everyone 's obsessed with student- teacher ratios , but student- teacher ratios assume a model that if there 's one of me and ten of you , then we can have a conversation . If there 's one of me and 20 of you , we 're going to have less of a conversation . If there 's one of me and 100 of you , we 're not going to have a conversation . That 's true , to some degree , but here , everyone works at their own pace . Even if there 's 100 students and one paid tutor , because you have this interaction , I 'm willing to bet that you 're going to have a better interaction with that one paid teacher who can now be paid 100 grand a year , instead of what teachers get paid . You 're going to have a better interaction in this world with a 100 : 1 student- teacher ratio , than you 'd probably get in even the fanciest private schools that there are right now . This right here , this is literally the summer program had asked about this and I was curious myself . This was literally me just doing sequel queries in the data every night from the summer camp . It 's not like a rigorous study , but to me , it speaks to the power of every student working at their own pace and throws into question , the traditional notions of assessment , which we , I think , sense are ( unintelligible ) to begin with . What this chart is doing , this axis right here is the days in the summer camp . It was a six- week program and this is just a count of the modules completed . This black line right here , that 's the class mean , the class average . On day seven in this class of 30 or so students , the average student has completed 23 modules . That 's what that tells us . You can actually even see that they all started at 1+1 . It was actually an interesting idea , because we started another group not at 1+1 and some subset of the students always got stuck . They just never moved on , even though we started them at fifth grade and they were seventh graders , some subset always got stuck . We saw when we started everyone at 1+1 , no one got stuck , which tells you that there are some smart people who have some gaps and it never gets addressed otherwise . You can have the best algebra teacher on the planet and you can have an innately very intelligent kid , but if he or she just is a little foggy on multiplying decimals , there 's no hope , they 're just going to talk past each other and it 's just going to be a very frustrating experience . When we started everyone at 1+1 , and you see it here . It 's a very steep curve , this is the review . This was the kids just getting ten in row , ten in row , ten in a row . Then it starts to level out a bit . This is , you can see the learning happening . The interesting thing , at least to me , the interesting thing about this is the green lines are standard deviation above and below that mean . You can plot all the students here , but this student in particular , on day five , if you did a pre- assessment for the class , if you did an assessment right here , he only completed 12 modules . More than one standard deviation below the mean . If you were in the traditional , if you were tracking students , you 'd say , " Oh , she 's a remedial student , " she 's going to hold the class back , " or we have to hold the rest of the class back for her . " She doesn 't belong in here , " all that and you would put a big label on her forehead . " You 're never going to be an engineer , " and all of these things and actually it does happen around sixth or seventh grade . That is when these labels , these careers get ruled out for students . Because she was able to spend a little - I was curious , I was like , " What happened to her ? " and I could go into the data and I could see exactly what she was doing . She was spending more time than everyone else on adding and subtracting negative numbers . Just to understand this chart right here , each bar , this is the first problem she did . Red is wrong , blue is right , and the height is how long it took her . This is just from the data of the interaction . You can see she got a couple of questions wrong , then she maybe guessed one right , then you have this big long time she actually watched the video here . I looked at the video log . She watched the video here , then she got a couple more right , but then she still got a few wrong . Once again , in a traditional classroom , she would have been said , " Oh , at this point you are an A student . " You got nine of ten right , or you got 19/ 20 right " and you 're an A student , " and force her to keep going . A couple more right , one wrong , then finally she got ten in a row . You can actually see that she also got faster on it . There 's a whole other element of speed , which does matter on some standardized tests . Once she got through that , once she was able to just remediate herself and really build a strong foundation , she just raced ahead . This was just in six weeks . She went from being the second to worst student in the class , if you want to measure that way , to the second to third best . All the students are on the chart here . In just six weeks . It makes you question , if you did an assessment here , and I show that because she literally raced through level three linear equations , which is like 2x+7=- 3x- 4 and she just thought it was intuitive after doing maybe level two . She just raced . If you saw that student , you 'd say , " Oh , she 's gifted . " ( laughter ) It makes you really question . We were just the lucky kids that got assessed at the right time and got all positive feedback and we were assessed at that point , but there 's probably a lot of people who might 've been able to eat our lunch eventually , who got kicked off . This , I show this , this is data from YouTube . I think everything I talked about before is how do you make sure a student learns properly and how do you make sure that their foundation is built and how do you use that data to optimize the actual physical interactions , but I show this to show that there 's another dimension of perfecting the actual content . This is data that YouTube gives me . They call this audience attention . What they do is they measure the drop off rate off of a YouTube video relative to the average YouTube video of that length . Let 's say the average YouTube video at minute three has lost 40 % of its audience . That 's just a natural drop off rate . At minute three , if I 've lost 40 % of my audience , I 'll be hugging the line right there . If I 've only lost 20 % of my audience , I 'll be above average . That 's what they 're measuring there , but you can imagine - Actually , I 've seen a few of my videos where this curve does this . It just drops off . I can go at that exact minute in the video and see , Oh , I said orthogonality and I never defined orthogonality . I can either re- record the video , I could put a little bubble there , where you can get more information . You 're getting real data that allows you to actually iterate and perfect on what you 're producing and you can imagine two dimensions , this is attention . You could also have efficacy , if you couple it with the actual exercise and you keep iterating on it until you have a gem of a video and you can even have multiple people 's videos and see what 's better for different people . This all exists in Netflix . There 's no reason why it shouldn 't exist in education . This right here is the big picture . I 'm talking about a virtual school for the world . This is what I think it 's going to be and I 'm open to any ideas or any nuance parts of it , but you have your video library . That 's the low- hanging fruit , it 's the first line of instruction , you can pause it and repeat it . One thing , I spoke to a journal of higher education recently and sometimes I 'm very diplomatic , I don 't rock too many boats , but I was in a quirky mood and I hadn 't eaten for a long time . ( laughter ) People who know my eating habits , I often don 't eat for long periods of time , but I just went off . I was like , " I challenge you , " because this is a journal read by professors and educators . I was like , " Why does a 300 person lecture even exist anymore ? " In what way , just tell me one way that that is better than on- demand video . I 'm happy for any of you all to - It 's this broadcast lecture to a room of people in a certain amount of time that 's 90 minutes long , people have gaps , and the professor sees blank faces . It 's just this all around - I think the only reason it exists is because people associate it with the college experience . People expect when I pay 30 or $40, 000 , I should get this . That 's the only , in my mind , why it exists . With on- demand video you can pause , repeat it . The producer can get data on what 's working , what 's not . You can get your best professors to produce the best content and keep iterating it , making it better and better . People can fill in their gaps . That 's what the video library 's all about . Then you have the web applications . You saw one of them , but there 's actually another one . There 's some gentlemen in the back of the room who started working on it . There 's a whole suite of web applications you can build for allowing people to learn at their own pace . What you saw was for math . We 're working on something . I 'd be happy to talk about it if you 're all curious for more fact- based knowledge . Learning american history or geography , things like that . You can even have web applications for peer assessment , for creative writing , all sorts of things . When you actually compose things for other people to review , it becomes a whole other level , whole other game than when you 're writing something for a teacher to mark up and say you 're a B+ and then throw it away . There 's a whole suite of web applications you can build and then on top of that you use all of that data to actually facilitate peer- to- peer interactions . I hinted that in the classroom , but there 's no reason why it just has to be limited to the classroom . If I 'm having trouble with quantum mechanics and the best instructor for quantum mechanics is in Mexico City and we 're both free at 4 : 00 PM eastern time , no reason that we can 't set up an interaction with a pen tablet , the way I used to do it with my cousin Nadia and have an interaction , even better record that interaction , so that other people in the future can use it . I rate them based on how they were , they can even rate me on how I was as a student and the system knows what I did before and after that interaction . It actually knows whether it was a statistically significant intervention in some way . This is the big picture and you can just keep getting the data and iterating and iterating and iterating it to make it a better solution . That 's the master plan . ( laughter ) Any questions ? Yeah . I know you 've got this initial focus of K through 12 and math and whatnot . Audience Member : Audience Member : Sorry , we can 't hear the question . Audience Member : Okay , one of the things you said really struck me as an educator , which is your comment about everyone should be forced to be an A student . If you think about this is a ( unintelligible ) exercise with a lot of unwilling institutions trying to get them to change . It seems to me that this idea , just this one idea would be very powerful to take into professional certification , say nursing degrees , where you 're not going to be a nurse until you achieve this level of competency on the exam . Take a profession , where this idea that everybody does have to be an A student in order to have a career and get them to buy into this model and maybe get the resources from that sort of problem or that sort of field to test these ideas out and to show how they work or they find implementation or whatever . Sal : I think it exists in professional development , because people say , " Look , if you 're a nurse " and you don 't know this , people are going to die , " so they do enforce that with doctors , nurses , and - That exists , but it isn 't - We could do studies , but I think it 's almost intuitive that if you go back to - Someone that has real mastery of algebra is going to be way more powerful than someone who has B - student level of understanding of algebra through differential equations . They 're never going to be able to apply any of it , as opposed to - I 've worked at - When I was working at a hedge fund , there was once a CFO who said - I was like , " What 's your incremental gross margin ? " He 's like , " Oh , we don 't divulge that . " I was like , " You just gave it to me . " You told me your gross profit in two periods " and how many units you sold in two periods ( laughter ) " That 's your - Everyone in the room was like , " Oh my God , " this is some kind of rocket science , " ( laughter ) That is algebra one , that is algebra one , and no one in the room . There are MBAs , there were PhDs in the room , very smart people , but no one could recognize and that is a failure and these are the successful people in our education system . People need to - If we had real mastery of algebra , the world would be a different place . All the calculus and all of that other stuff would just be for fun , but it 's not - I don 't even think it has to be tested . If people really understood algebra , that 's going to be way better than people halfway understanding algebra and then moving on to other things . Yeah ? Audience Member : A question about the peer- to- peer interaction . Do you see that happening now , actually ? If you have 16 million views on YouTube , I imagine there 's comments . Is there comment moderation happening ? Sal : You all can go home and look . Some of the debates or even some of the commentary on the YouTube videos are like what teachers would dream of having in their classroom . Someone says , " Hey , this was a great video , " but I don 't quite get what Sal did at minute 2 : 34 , " and there 's a little link in YouTube you can go right back to that little point in the video . Then other people will comment on it and say , " Oh , you just have to watch that other video " and he explains that in depth , " or , " Here 's another page you can watch , " or they 'll actually just explain it right there . This is just on a simple message board . It definitely already exists and it 's literally just - I get at least five emails a day asking for a better community to tap into this and I 've just been waiting to do it right . It 's there and people love to help each other and they just don 't have a good way of doing it right now . Audience Member : I have children in the first grade and fourth grade . What would you suggest I do with them with this ? Sal : First through fourth ? Audience Member : First and fourth . Sal : This is not scientific . I 've tried out the app with different aged kids . The 1+1 , it is 1+1 but it doesn 't have dancing bears . ( laughter ) I hope to eventually have dancing - Everyone likes dancing ( laughter ) A Kindergartner . I found Kindergarten - I 've seen some precocious second or third graders get into it . They don 't need the dancing bears and the music and all of that type of thing . Your fourth grader , I think , could be ready for this . The videos I 've seen very young kids like them . They like the - I don 't know what they like about it . They like the black background and the colors . They respond to the videos . I 've seen three or four year olds , it holds their attention . I don 't know if they 're retaining anything . ( laughter ) You might want to start with the videos for your younger student , but the fourth grader , I think , is ready for the app . Audience Member : The younger kid goes straight to the YouTube . Sal : Yeah , I think so , and you might want to watch it with them . Some people have told me that they watch a couple of videos at night with their kid and it 's in place of a bedtime story . ( laughter ) Why not ? Audience Member : Are your videos in your system a little too big for one laptop per child ? The question is your video and your system a little too big for one laptop per child ? Audience Member : What 's the question ? Sal : I guess there 's a couple of - In terms of ... Audience Member : Getting any of that content to them , because right now I think they 're just doing textbook format , right ? Yeah , so the question is , is it too big for getting the content into one laptop per child ? Sal : The easy answer is no . When I first saw one laptop per child , this is before Khan Academy was really well thought out , I was like , " What are they going to do on that one laptop per child ? " There 's examples of people using it for lights and things as opposed to for a computer . I think it could be used tomorrow on one laptop per child . Audience Member : But do they have enough drive space and things like that ? A lot of them don 't have network connectivity . The raw videos , they 're going to be on iTunes U soon , so I just talked to the Apple people and I handed them the disk that had all the raw videos and it was 40 gigs . Sal : I think if you took the Flash versions , it 's 14 gigs . I don 't know how big the hard drives are , though , but soon they 're going to be able to store all of the - Audience Member : It 's actually something you should look into , because that 's a big deal , right ? Sal : I would love to . If they called me up , I 'd say , " Yeah . " ( laughter ) I 'd love to , I 'd love to . We can have another talk about - I 'm talking to a couple of foundations . One laptop per child would be awesome if there 's the resources , but you don 't necessarily need one laptop per child . Get some $200 refurbished PC , put it in the village . Now , all of a sudden , you can have asynchronous learning , which is what these village kids need , because they have to take off for the harvest , they have a whole spectrum . Some of them can 't read , some of them have pretty reasonable proficiency . That $200 refurbished PC , instead of being one per student , you have 20 students per day working on it , each half an hour a day , doing this type of thing , and then as a foundation , for the first time in the history of philanthropic giving , you actually have real data on what 's happening in real time on the actual utilization on your assets , where students are , how they 're performing and in terms of the actual cost , it 's a $200 PC that 'll last four years , so it 's $50 a year and you 're educating 20 students . That 's $2 . 50 per student per year for an education , which is competitive with anywhere in the third world . It 's cheaper than pencil and paper . I think that 's what should be the model , but if they get a laptop that 's even better . Oh , in the back , yeah . I think you said you do all the video and lectures yourself . Audience Member : How long does it take you to put together a module ? There 's some topic areas surely you don 't know all of it . ( laughter ) Sal : A video , if it 's a work - There 's probably people emailing me right now some algebra . I think I may really be doing some kid 's homework for them . Those type of things where it 's just an algebra problem , someone emails it to me , I haven 't done that exact problem before , let me just do it , that 's the ten minutes on the video , plus five minutes to upload , it 's a very small amount of time . If you saw that first screen , I 've started doing world history videos . Those take a lot of - Audience Member : What do you mean by a lot ? Sal : When I started on the French Revolution , I spent a week doing nothing but reading on the French Revolution . I literally just took time off and I steeped myself in the French Revolution . I think we 've all found this when we were going to school is that when you 're in the midst of a class , you really are an expert for that short period of time until the exam you are an expert , but then it all goes away . ( laughter ) For that short period of time , you can talk to any academic anywhere in the world and you know all of the details and the nuances and everything . About a week of studying and it 's fun studying . It 's not for an exam , it 's for me and I get to make YouTube videos . I 'll do that and then I 'll start making the videos and then I can probably produce two or three videos a day . Once I have the big picture and I understand the major pieces and I have a sense of - If you watch those videos , I cut and paste a bunch of images and maps from Wikipedia and I just explain them . I 'm a big map person , so I do that . In the back ? Audience Member : Is the software that you use to do things like draw perfectly straight lines or doing a ratio something you can buy off the shelf ( unintelligible ) or did you design that all yourself ? No , some people have offered to pay for it , but I didn 't build any software . Sal : Actually , all I use is I started off using Microsoft Paint . I made the background black and I used this thing called Screen Video Recorder , too , which is this shareware , freeware , or $20 screen capture software . That 's what I started the first 500 videos were done like that . Then someone just sent me a Camtasia license . They 're like , " This is great , we need to ( unintelligible ) . " You need a better screen capture . " So I started using Camtasia and then I used Smooth Draw , too , which is pressure sensitive , so it actually looks like I 'm writing with a pen , as opposed to Microsoft Paint , but you could get set up for $200 at home with exactly what I have . It 's all found stuff . There 's probably better stuff out there . What I 'm using right now , I can 't draw a straight line . With Microsoft Paint I could , because it had the line tool . In line with your idea of this as entertainment , so replacing bedtime stories , I think there 's a niche for retirees . Audience Member : I know any number of people who , first thing in the morning , do three crosswords and a sudoku . Sal : Exactly . Audience Member : ( unintelligible ) Sal : ( unintelligible ) My mother in law ( unintelligible ) ( laughter ) I have gotten letters from retirees saying that they started doing it instead of sudoku and other than keeping them sharp , they 're not connecting with their grandkids . They 're becoming the grandkids ' tutor and this is a whole level of connection that they couldn 't have before , so there is something . Not the retirees , there 's a lot of homeschooling parents - I think there 's a lot of homeschoolers who are doing great until about algebra and then they 're like , " What do I do next ? " This is helping them out . There 's a lot of people who surprise me . There 's a lot of military people who are actually my age who are going back to college . If you think about it , if you 're in your mid- 30s and you want to go back to college , and the first thing you 're going to see when you go to college is college algebra and ( unintelligible ) There is nothing out there for you . You 're helpless and this is the only thing that 's out there and they 're eternally thankful that they could re- learn arithmetic and algebra and all these things that they haven 't seen for 20 years . It 's surprising . I have an eighth grader and my question is , would you say that the videos sometimes could replace going back to the textbook when they get stuck , or - Audience Member : Sal : Yeah , so the question and this - Audience Member : Because the textbooks - Sal : Oh , don 't get me started about textbooks . ( laughter ) No , I will get started about textbooks . The question was , " I have an eighth grader . " Do you think the videos can replace the textbook ? " Let 's think about what a textbook is . There 's two things in a textbook . There 's something that claims to be some form of explanation , two pages of text on something , and then it 's exercises . There 's 50 problems ( unintelligible ) . I guarantee you on- demand video , whether it 's Khan Academy or anybody , is going to be better than that prose or whatever you want to call it , that 's trying to explain the concept and it 's usually explained more for peer- review , more for the other textbook authors saying , " Oh yes , he did it rigorously , that 's excellent , " as opposed for the eighth grader who wants - Audience Member : ( unintelligible ) Sal : Exactly , I think there 's a small subset of people who could actually read a textbook and that 's what a lot of us would probably get where we got , because we could actually consume that information , but most people - On- demand video is better than that and from an exercise point of view , the textbook company doesn 't know who 's doing what exercise when , who 's watching what , what 's actually being effective . They 're not getting real- time data . That stuff I showed - You can argue what the modules should look like , but something like that is going to be infinitely better , especially if you can tweak it and get data on what 's working , what are people using . For all we know , textbook publishers , half of those problems are never touched by anybody . They 're in there and kids are getting hernias carrying those problems around and it 's a - The answer 's yes , I think that textbooks need to go , on a lot of levels . Audience Member : So for world history , what kind of problems do you put out there so you can make your assessment ? The question is for world history what kind of problems can you put out there ? Sal : What I showed you , those modules , that 's good for something that can be templatized , that you can map . You can even do some physics problems like that , the core problems . You could do some types of chemistry , maybe genetics , but what about the causes of the Civil War . Audience Member : Not just that , but analysis of complex issues . Sal : Yeah , there 's two levels of things like history . One is the , " What did Millard Fillmore do ? " There 's that level and then there 's the level of , " Let 's talk about the impacts of slavery today , " or something . The core stuff , and that 's what I 'm working on with those two gentlemen in the back there . Literally I met them , ( unintelligible ) we met last week , but what we 're working on is a - We 're working on - If we were studying for a factual based thing , we would get together in a big study group and write flash cards for each other and then quiz each other on each other 's questions . What we 're working on is a world - For American History , put the whole curriculum there and then if you say , " I 'm going to write a question " on the Antebellum Period . " Click Antebellum , you write a question , you can embed a video , image , whatever you want . Once you feel good about it , you put the correct choice , incorrect choices , explanation . Once you feel good about it , you publish it . If I 'm the first person to see your question , I 'll say , " Hey , warning , this is an untouched question , " and all of that stuff , but you should try it out . I do the question , I rate it on quality , difficulty , and importance and then you start building this library of questions with metadata around it and you can imagine that you 're collecting data , people who knew this question didn 't know that question , so you can quantitatively say what 's easy or what 's harder . There 's all sorts of ways you can consume the question . You could imagine a teacher , because you 're getting all of this data . You know exactly how long it takes for a certain type of student to complete a question , whether they get it right or wrong . You can imagine a history teacher , once you get this huge data , this huge library questions , like you know what , I want to administer an exam to my history students tomorrow , I 'm going to bring them to the computer lab . I want 50 questions and I don 't want more than a 95 % chance that more than two people aren 't going to finish that exam and we 'll have all of the data , because it 'll know for that level of student how long it 'll take them , it 'll do the statistical model and then , bam , ( unintelligible ) . That 's for the core and you can do that for anything . ( unintelligible ) The more nuanced stuff , that 's an open question . I 'm open to ideas . I think there 's things , a peer review of essays , or you could argue through essays and have people vote on who 's argument is better . There 's all sorts of things you can do . That hasn 't been - Foreign language , I was thinking , I have a 15 month old . Skype exists , the best foreign language , I 'm going to have him chat for a half an hour a week with somebody in Mexico City , Dubai , Hong Kong . Half an hour a week and he 'll just chat . That 's foreign language . I think there 's some very simple things with found technology right now that that could solve some of these problems . The immersion , as opposed to ( unintelligible ) . Oh , yeah ? Audience Member : Very curious to hear your thoughts about the Texas Board of Education and - Sal : What about education ? Audience Member : Have you heard about the Texas Board of Education ? Sal : Oh , the Texas Board of Education ( crosstalk ) Audience Members : They 're trying to rewrite the textbooks , especially around American history . I 'm wondering if that made you rethink about your mission with Khan Academy or - Sal : Oh yeah , that 's interesting . He 's asking about the Texas Board of Education , the rewriting of American History and all that . From a personal level , that 's the power of this thing . I could all of a sudden - I do every now and then go on Google blog search and I see who 's using these Khan Academy videos . Obviously , it 's a lot of homeschoolers and all that , but actually , a White Supremacy group loves the Khan Academy . ( laughter ) Because they 're like , " This is quality instruction , " our kids aren 't getting it , this is the only way " that they 're going to be able to compete with the Asians " and the Jews and the - ( laughter ) They could 've gotten me to teach them , or they would 've let me get into their house and teach their kid , but because they recognize that this is better than what they 're getting in the school , I 'm able to get into those kids ' heads , ( laughter ) which would never ( unintelligible ) ( laughter ) I think that whole Texas thing , I think it 's a non- issue . I think with the internet and all that , they can debate night and day over what should be in the textbook , no one 's going to care at the end of the day , because they 're going to get information from other sources . The reality is most of the kids aren 't learning what they 're trying to put in the textbooks , so who cares ? ( laughter ) Audience Member : Are you able to - Different people learn in different ways . For example , some people might learn with examples and other people want to learn more deductively . Can you identify the ways that people learn and then adjust the instruction to match the special need ? Yeah , the question was can you adjust to deductive learners versus people who need examples ? Sal : We could . I don 't do it yet , I don 't claim that it 's already done and all that , but it definitely could be done and that 's another value of this . Some people say , " Oh , are you teaching it this new way or regrouping " or are you teaching the old way with borrowing " or are you teaching the abstract manipulative way " or are you teaching ... Let 's do both , let 's do both , and people can pick and choose what they want or do both . In a traditional classroom , you have to make these decisions because you have a scarce amount of time , scarce amount of resources , you have to teach it this way or that way , but here you can teach them both ways . Teach it the deductive way and then do a lot of examples , because that 's the way most people enjoy it . There 's nothing to stop you from doing it . Audience Member : I saw the graph earlier , where you show how you get from ( unintelligible ) all the way through and that 's how the ( unintelligible ) works to build a foundation and you can extend that even further by anything that 's factual , history or geography , by taking the graph ( unintelligible ) . You can imagine , after you just learned about the French Revolution , and a lesson about French geography , you could then be offered to take a look at ( unintelligible ) for example and since you 've learned about ( unintelligible ) you can learn about ( unintelligible ) can get you to ( unintelligible ) you can always relate it to something you already know . Especially once you have a question library and you think about the best way to navigate it . Sal : Right now it 's just a curriculum . You can say , " I want to learn about the French Revolution , " but ( unintelligible ) organically , what you 're suggesting . I haven 't built it , but it can be built today , and it 's kind of silly that it 's not being built , especially considering how leverage- able something like that is . Have you thought about teaching parents , educators , teachers on how to teach , how to communicate effectively to your audience , how to troubleshoot where the hangups , the gaps are . Audience Member : The questions is have I ever thought about teaching to educators or parents how to - Sal : There 's an interesting story there , too . This was when Khan Academy was like , I was happy if anyone called me ( unintelligible ) Three years ago , Miami Dade contacted me and said , " Can we use your videos for teacher training ? " I was like , " Yeah , sure , that 's awesome . " You all are real educators and you all want to use my videos . I was like , " but why don 't you let the students use them , too . " ( laughter ) There is a reality now where ... I think there would be value in telling teachers , " Look , you don 't have to be perfect , just be human , " and just be conversational , and don 't talk down , " and don 't try to use this as a power exertion type " of classroom management type of thing , use it - I don 't blame teachers , because the system forces them to manage a classroom , demand respect , if they have a gap in their knowledge , you can 't be honest . If you do that in a classroom then they 're going to undermine you . There 's all these other dynamics that occur why a teacher can 't be human . We 're in a world where we 'll probably get a subset of teachers who are scaling up and then the rest of the teachers leverage this to become the human one- on- one mentor and I think that 'll be the value . It 'll just be kind of example if they say , " Hey , let 's watch this together , " and then , " Did you get it ? " If you don 't then I 'll be your mentor to walk you through it . " I 'd be happy to if anyone was interested in me doing ( unintelligible ) anything like that , but yeah . Audience Member : I 'm curious about the peer- to- peer interactions and community and how you 've got and where you could be going . You 've touched on a couple of things I think are just world- changing . Intergenerational , knowledge transfer , wisdom , you talked about one room schoolrooms , but what about just the usual parent- child . There 's so much that could happen using this model . Where are you ? Yeah , so the peer- to- peer , that 's at the most on the drawing board right now . Sal : I haven 't ... I 've tried it out with my cousins as a one off basis . I feel like it 'll definitely work and the data is being set off , but knock on whatever this is made out of . ( laughter ) Hopefully in the next few weeks we 'll get some resources to start doing - That 's the most technically intensive and we want to get to the point where not only are we doing peer- to- peer and it 's seamless and it 's capturing data , but it 's also recording those interactions . You need some - Once you record , then it 's ( unintelligible ) . I agree with the whole teacher , with the - I want a world where you can - If your parents want to take you to Europe , it 's not going to compete with your school . You go on that trip to Europe and maybe there 's another one room schoolhouse part of the same network that you can go to and meet the kids in Paris while you 're there . On the plane you can do - ( unintelligible ) I agree with you completely . The peer- to- peer is the hardest to do and it 's going to be the one that maybe happens , but I think it 'll happen in the next five years . I think the potential is large . What 's the optimal length or range for the different modules and how many times do you have to retape it to satisfy yourself that it 's good enough ? Audience Member : The question is , what 's the optimal length for I 'm assuming the videos especially and how many times do I have to retape it ? Sal : When I started off , YouTube limits you to 10 minutes . Now they let me do longer videos , I 'm a partner and all of that , but when you start off it 's 10 minutes , so my first video was 11 minutes and they didn 't let me upload it . ( laughter ) I paid attention to the clock and I made my videos around nine or ten minutes . That 's the single biggest point of feedback that that is the ideal amount of time to get one concept across while being able to pay attention . I 've gotten letters from people . I 've talked to some people at Google who have done some user interface stuff and how long people can pay attention and they said , " Yeah , it 's about ten minutes . " I think that might even be what motivated YouTube to figure out the limit , but that forced me to do that . One , that 's a granular chunk that allows people to pay attention . It turns it into one of these DaVinci Code Dan Brown type novels where each chapter 's three pages and you 're like , " Okay , I 'm done , " and you get a sense of completion , as opposed to a 90 minute lecture that you can only watch 40 minutes and you feel - This also makes it very granular . You can really just jump in and get exactly what you need as opposed to sitting through a 90 minute lecture and trying to find - I 've found that ten minutes is now I 'm getting to - Actually , I 've done a few videos now that are pushing 20 minutes , but that 's just my fault . I really think everything can be done in ten minutes . Your other thing is how many times do I do it ? Do you have to tape and retape several times to get it to where you want it ( crosstalk ) Audience Member : Sal : Oh quality ? Audience Member : Yeah . Sal : How many times do I have to - When I started , since it was for my cousins , I literally would record it and put up . ( laughter ) There 's actually one or two videos where I 'm answering telemarketer calls . ( laughter ) I didn 't care . Why re- record it ? It 's for Nadia . This is free ( unintelligible ) . That 's another takeaway . People like that informality , they like that - I make mistakes . I would say one out of every 12 videos I make on arithmetic , I forget a negative number or I forget a negative sign or I say 16- 8 is 5 . I do something bizarre and people really like that . ( laughter ) Or I start a problem and go around the wrong path first and I say , " Oh wait , that 's not right . " I 've gotten positive feedback on those things because you never see it . When you go to a class , the teacher they have the script , they 've done that problem 20 times and they just do it perfect . You 're an idiot if you didn 't see this , obvious steps , but when you see someone who kind of knows what they 're doing , they follow their intuition in one direction , it was wrong , that 's okay , that 's the art of mathematics , of solving a problem . Then you go down a complete other path . I try now that it 's getting more notoriety , I feel like , " Oh my God , so many people are going to watch this video , " let me re- do it , " but I find the more I think that way it hurts the quality of the video . Audience Member : Does Kaplan or any of the other paid for online services , Phoenix University , do any of them view you as a competitive threat , being free ? Sal : They should . ( laughter ) I 've actually spoke to the research group at Apollo Group , which is the parent company for the University of Phoenix . I think they 're aware of it now . I 've talked to Princeton Review about potentially - Because I would like to do something with their materials and all of that . In any of these groups , even textbook publishers , I 've talked to a few , there 's a group that 's very insecure about everything , but there 's another view that 's like , " Look , this is out there " and this could even empower your instruction .

So we ran off to a sushi bar .
I believe they are called the peppered moth , and this was in pre- industrial revolution England , that these moths , that some of the moths were - let me see if I can draw a moth to give you the idea , you know , let me draw a couple of them , let me draw a few peppered moths . A couple of peppered moths there . Let me draw one more . So , most peppered moths there was just this variation , some of them were I guess we could call them more peppered than others . So , some of them might look like this , you know . No let me do another colour . Let 's do white . So it has spots like that , some of them might have looked more like that . And of course they also had some black spots on them . And then some of them might have been , you know , almost - barely have any spots . You just have this natural variation like you would see in any population of animals . You 'll see some variation in colours . Now they were all happy , probably for thousands of years , just this natural variation . Just this it was a non- important trait for these peppered moths but then all of a sudden the industrial revolution happens in England , and all of this soot gets released from all of these factories that are running these steam engines powered by coal , and so , all of a sudden all of these things that once were grey or white , for example maybe some tree trunks - let me draw some tree trunks - may there were some tree trunks that used to look like this , you know , may be it looked like a maybe it kept the , maybe some tree trunks looked something like this and a peppered moth would be pretty OK , maybe there were some tree trunks were pretty dark , but all of a sudden the industrial revolution happened , everything gets covered with soot from the coal being burned and then all of a sudden all the trees look like this : They are completely pitch black or they are a lot darker than they were before . Now all of a sudden you have had a major change to these moths ' environment , and you have to think : What is going to select for these moths ? Well , one thing that might get these moths are birds and the ability of these birds to see the moths . So all of a sudden if the environment became a lot blacker than it was before you can guess what is going to happen : The birds are gonna see this dude a lot easier than they are gonna see this dude , cause this dude on the black background is gonna be a lot harder to see . And it is not like the birds won 't catch this guy , they 'll catch all of them , but they 're gonna catch this guy a lot more frequently . So you can imagine what happens if the birds start catching these guys before they can reproduce or may be while they are reproducing what 's going to happen : This guy , the darker dudes are going to reproduce a lot more often and all of a sudden you 're gonna have a lot more moths that look like this . You 're gonna have a lot more of these dudes . So what happened here ? Was there any design or was there any active change by any of the moths ? It looks like a really smart thing to do , to become black . Your surroundings became black and you wait for a couple of generations of these moths and all of a sudden the moths are black and you say : Wow , these moths are geniuses . They all somehow decided to evolve into black moths in order to hide from the birds more easily . But that is not what happened . You had a lot of variation in your peppered moth population and what happened was that when everything turned darker and darker , these dudes right here , and dudettes , had a lot less success in reproducing . You had a bunch of them . These guys just reproduced more and more and more and these guys got eaten up before they were able to reproduce or may while they were reproducing so that they couldn 't produce as many offspring and then this trait became dominant . and then the peppered moth became - you can kind of view it as a black moth . Now you might say : OK Sal , that is one example , but I need more . This is natural selection , this is purported to apply to everything , it purports to explain why we evolved from basic bacteria or maybe from self replicating RNA which I will talk about more in the future . You know , I need more evidence of this - you know - I need to see it in real time . and the best example of this is really the flu is really the flu . And I 'll do other videos in the future on what viruses are and how they replicate and viruses actually are fascinating , because it is not actually clear that they are alive , they 're literally just little buckets of DNA and sometimes RNA which we 'll learn is genetic information and they 're just contained in these viral ... these little protein containers that are these neat geometrical shapes and that 's all they are , they really don 't have - you know - they are not like regular living organisms , that actively move and that actively have metabolisms and all that . What they do is they take that little DNA and then they inject it into other things that can process it and then they use that DNA to produce more viruses . But anyway , I could , we could do a whole series of videos on viruses , but the flu is a virus and what happens every year is that you have a certain type of virus a certain type of virus and they have some variation and I 'll just make the variation by how many dots they have . how many dots they have and they , in fact , - let 's say it is a human flu , they infect humans - and slowly our immune systems , which we could make a whole set of videos on as well , start to recognize the virus and are able to attack them before they can do a lot of damage . So now you can imagine what happens , if let 's say this is the current flu , let me do all of them , they all have these little two dots and that 's how and we 'll talk in the future about what these dots are . and how they can be recognized , but let 's say that 's how our immune system recognizes them . they start realizing : O , any time I get this little green dude with 2 dots on it , that is not a good thing to have around . So I am going to attack it in some way and destroy it before he infects my immune system and DNA and all the rest . And so you have a very strong natural selection once immune systems learn what this virus is and we 'll talk more about what learning means for an immune system . that they 'll start attacking these guys , right ? But flu , you can kind of think of them as being tricky , but they are not really tricky , they are not sentient objects . But what they do do : They constantly change . so what you have in any flu population , you 're always having a little bit of change , so may be the great majority of them have those two dots , but may be every now and then one of them has one dot , one of them has 3 dots , and maybe that is just a random mutation , this just randomly happened , maybe one in every - I 'll make up a number - one in every million of these viruses has this only one dot instead of two dots , but what 's gonna happen as soon as the human immune system gets used to attacking the virus with the two red dots , well then this guy isn 't gonna have to compete with the other virus capsules for infecting people he 's going to have people 's DNA all to himself . He or she or what ever you want to call this virus , is then going to be more successful so by next year 's flu season when people start sneezing and are able to spread it on door knobs and whatever else again , This guy is going to be the new flu virus . So when you see this process of every year there is a new flu virus , that is evolution and natural selection in real time . It is happening ! It isn 't this thing that only happens over eons and eons of time . Although most of the substantial things that we see in our lives or even in ourselves are based on these things that happened over eons and eons of time , but it happens on a yearly basis . Another example is if you think about antibiotics and bacteria . Bacteria are these little cells that move around and we 'll talk more about them , they are definitely living , they have metabolisms and whatever else . And so this is just a nice thing to know : When people talk about infections it could either be a viral infection which are these things that go and infect your DNA and then use your cell mechanisms to reproduce or it could be a bacterial infection which are literally little cells and they move around and they release toxins that make you sick and whatever else , so bacteria these are what antibiotics kill . Anti- biotics . Actually I don 't think there is a hyphen : Antibiotics . They attack bacteria , they kill them . Now you 've probably , if you know a couple of doctors or whatever , and you say : Hey I am sick , I think I have bacterial infection , give me some antibiotics , a responsible doctor says : No I shouldn 't give you antibiotics just willy nilly , because what happens is that the more antibiotics you use , you 're more likely to create versions and I want to be very careful about the word create , because you are not actively creating them , but let 's say - and let me finish my sentence - you are very likely to help select for antibiotic- resistant bacteria . Now how does that work ? Now let 's say this is a green let 's say that these are all bacteria and you have bazillions of them , right ? And every now and then , you get one that is slightly different . Now in a random population of bacteria these all will make you equally sick and this is just some random difference in the bacteria may be on his DNA some slightly different changes happened , but whatever happened , these all are the kind of bacteria that you don 't want to get a lot of them in your system . Your immune system can attack them and fight them off . If you get a lot of them they might kill you or make you sick or whatever else . Now , if everyone just starts using antibiotics when they are not sick or when they don 't really need to in a life or death situation , you might have an antibiotic that is really good at killing the green bacteria . But what happens if you all of a sudden kill a lot of the green bacteria ? Well , now the blue bacteria have the whole ecosystem , that before it was competing with all these green dudes to get at your - get all the good stuff inside of your body , but now he is all alone and now he can replicate willy nilly , so now he is going to replicate willy nilly and obviously and this is - once again - it isn 't like there was any design , there was any intelligent process here that said : Hey look , this bacteria should , - you know , I am some bacteria - said : I am going to be a little bit smarter and design myself to resist this antibiotic threat . No , there is just these random changes that happened and mutations in viruses and bacteria happen frequently . And there are these random changes that happen and this might be this one in a billion change , right ? but all of a sudden if you start killing off all the people that it is competing with then this guy can start replicating really fast and then become the dominant bacteria and then all of a sudden that antibiotic that you had developed very carefully to destroy the green dudes is useless . And you have this superbug . You might have heard the word superbug . That is what a superbug is . It 's not like it designed itself somehow . It is just that we got very good at killing its competition and so we allowed it to take over and we can 't kill it , because all of the drugs were just good at killing its competition . And these bacteria just keep mutating and keep mutating and if we use these antibiotics a little bit too heavily , we will always be selecting for the things that won 't be affected by the antibiotics . Anyway , I think I have spoken long enough , but it is a fascinating fascinating topic and I really wanted to make this my very first , my very first - I guess - video or lecture if you will on biology , because if you really went to , you know : Biology is the study of life and we can talk about what life is whether viruses are living and what not , but if you really want to study living systems , you really can 't make any assumptions other than natural selection . We could go to another planet where the creatures don 't have DNA or may be they have some other type of hereditary information stored in their cells or they replicate in some other way or they are not even carbon based , may be they are silicon based and if we went to that type of a planet in order to study the biology on that planet everything else we know about biology and about viruses and DNA would be useless . But if we do understand this one concept , this one concept of natural selection , that your environment will select , and you know there is no active process here , it is just some random stuff happened and they randomly select for random changes and over large swats of time and these are unimaginably large swaths of time those changes essentially accumulate , and they might accumulate for fairly fairly significant things We 'll talk more about this in another video . See you soon ! One of the great privileges that I have had over the years is to engage with many different countries and cultures with all the richness that it brings .

Some variation might not matter at all , but some variations matter a lot . One example that is given in every biology book , but it really is interesting , is
And think of things in your life that are binary , one of them is light switches . They can be on and off . That 's binary .
As a result , parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies ' bodies , or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe .
It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
Now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device .
And the second is academic ability , which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence , because the universities designed the system in their image .

We knew nothing of a world beyond our own . We were aristocrats . Mr Fox ! I adored Caroline . I wonder what she did to provoke him . ln my eyes , she could do no wrong . We have dismissed Mr Fox . I am married ... .. to Mr Fox . I will not be disobeyed ! I wondered what would happen when my turn came . What would my parents require of me ? Admirers ? Allow me . - You can 't marry if Father won 't allow it ! - Can 't marry ! Can 't marry ! So , my lord , how do you occupy your time ? Well , er ... at the moment I 'm building a house . I should be sorry to be the cause of any disappointment , my lord , but my position is unalterable . I won 't give her a penny more . Her dowry is fixed at L10, 000 ... .. when her parents die . A distant event , one hopes . You must provide the rest . Marriage to one of our family confers such esteem that no financial advantage will be requested or given . My love for Lady Emily was not inspired by thoughts of fortune . What settlement do you consider ? This is the sum I require . Then that is the sum I agree . Have it drawn up . Patience and dutifulness on my part had softened my parents 'objections to Lord Kildare . He pays through the nose . There 's nothing we could fault . Nevertheless , my father drove a hard bargain . I was to be handed over with scarcely a guinea to my name . My father was unstinting , though , in his provisions for the wedding . The celebrations were magnificent and attended by all London ... including the King . Of course , my sister Caroline was not invited . Ah ! How is my pretty plumb cake ? Bien . Et vous ? - She speaks in tongues , Your Grace . - All my children speak French , sir . Shall we see what she says to this ? Of my two younger sisters , little Sarah was the King 's favourite . Shall we put the lid on ? She became something of a royal plaything . Oh . Listen . ? .. s 'en va- t- en guerre ? Avec une grande armee , avec une grande armee ? Mambru s 'en va- t- en guerre , mironton , mironton , mirontaine ? Mambru s 'en va- t- en guerre ? Avec une grande armee , avec une grande armee The little plumb cake is a patriot ! Just like her father , eh , Richmond ? Do you accept our offer ? You keep us waiting . It 's not the thing . - But do you still want me , sir ? - Of course . Of course . Then I am honoured to accept the position . Master of the Horse it is , then . Jemmy , we can 't ! Can we ? - Jemmy . - Mm- hm ? How many bedrooms does your house have in lreland ? I can 't remember . Why ? I 'm trying to imagine it . - ls it a little like Richmond House ? - Mm . Does it have ... pretty windows ? - Does it have a park ? - With spotty cattle . And black- faced sheep . I do like being married . My dearest . - Jemmy . - Mm ? You know what we must do tomorrow ? More of this , perhaps ? We must visit my sister . As a married woman , I answered first to my husband . My parents could not prevent me from visiting Caroline . And I did so , the day after my wedding . Henry ... do I look well ? Jemmy had no objection . He saw advantages in meeting Mr Fox , whose star was rising fast . My Lord and Lady Kildare . We wasted no time in catching up on the missed years and interrupted confidences . I can never express enough gratitude to you , Lord Kildare , for restoring my sister to me . I have wanted to make your acquaintance , Lady Caroline , and that of Mr Fox . May your domestic happiness be equal to my own . You have chosen the best available . Thank you for the compliment , Mr Fox . It is simply the truth . Well , this calls for a toast . To happiness in marriage . My darling Ste . He is sweeter than any baby is entitled to be . You can 't imagine what I feel for him . ls not the act of love ... .. strange ? Jemmy says that its frequent use is necessary to a woman 's health and happiness . That 's abominably indelicate . He says what he thinks . I 'm sure one sees many mighty comfortable old virgins . Perhaps that is so . But one is awfully glad not to be among them . Emily ! Oh ! Oh , dearest sis , we shall see too little of each other when you 're gone . I shall return from lreland often . To my eyes , lreland was not at all the place of bogs and cottages my mother had told me it would be . My eyes then , of course , were not as open as they might have been . I thought it a pretty country and , in parts , like the England I had left . lts houses , however , were in need of some improvement . As mistress in my own home at last , I set about the business of refurbishment . No . No . Try the other one again . Yes ! Yes , that 's it ! There 's Chinese silk upholstery of exceptional charm . More silk ? How much did it cost ? L200 . A little expensive . Oh , it is so beautiful . - Shall I put it on ? - Yes . I 'd give more than I could name to have the pleasure of taking it off . My husband 's feelings for me were such that I very quickly began to breed . I bred constantly . I loved my children . With annual regularity , I gave birth , was confined , and bred again . Good night , George . Good night , William . Yes . Emily , we cannot spend any more . I fear for my ruin . Henry . We were to go to the theatre . lndeed . - What time ? - We are much too late . We 'll go another time , my love . - I promise . - You promised before . I was looking forward to this . - There is nothing I can do . - There is nothing you wish to do ! - You are happier away from me . - You don 't believe that . Your Grace ? He will only talk to Mr Fox ! - Who , my dear ? - The King ! He will not listen to us ! He asks repeatedly if we 've won the war yet , and when we try to explain the difficulties of doing so , he calls for Mr Fox ! Because Mr Fox is the only man he can understand ! I never thought it a good likeness anyway . Jemmy , we must go to London . For what purpose ? You must bespeak me ... more stockings . - Can Dublin not furnish you with stockings ? - Dublin is out of stockings . I need the blue , embroidered with silk , seven pairs . And two pairs of ... .. the green with pink flocks . I will bespeak you a thousand . This talk of stockings ... and the sight of your dear , pretty legs ... .. makes me feel what is not to be expressed . - You are not fair , Mr Fox . - And you are very fair , Lady Kildare . I cannot argue with a pun , particularly if it flatters me . No- one can argue with Mr Fox . He always wins . I imagine Lady Kildare also has a habit of winning . Oh , I don 't contest . - I defer to Lord Kildare in all things . - Ah . ls that not so ? All things in the great world , perhaps . But in the matter of children and house , I think women have the wiser view . You would have us believe , my dear , that your opinions are confined to children and house ? They have the major share of my thoughts . Otherwise , my thoughts are commonplace . Let us hear these commonplace thoughts . I think war is a disgrace to human nature . It makes us rich . - But that should not be . It makes everyone rich . Our manufactories make arms , our merchants sell cloth for uniforms , our bankers make loans , our corn prices rise , and your father grows richer by the day as his coal is used . Such wealth is dearly bought , paid for by people 's lives ! Not by ours . I don 't want to profit from death , Henry . Perhaps I should refuse my pay . You said you wished to bring this war to a speedy end . Are you now saying you wish it to continue ? It doesn 't hinder my prospects . So this war is a useful instrument to your advancement . I said no such thing . War is a murdering trade and you talk of prospects ! ls the end of war not in sight ? I have never been more convinced of your being tired of me as I have been this last month . I know fidelity is not the custom amongst people of our rank , and there are some marriages where the presence of a mistress does not seem to disturb the wife . And perhaps I should be more ... accustomed . But I cannot bear it if I am not first in your heart . You think I have a mistress ? A mistress ! When should I find time for a mistress ? But if it was a servant , or an actress , perhaps I could bear it , but to be displaced by an equal ! An equal ? Who is she , Henry ? Listen ... There is no- one . There is only you . - You mean I have no rival ? - You are always in my thoughts . Wherever I am ... whoever I am with . You are the centre of my life . I think of you all the time . I think of you in the clamour of debate . I think of you ... when I 'm calculating the movement of troops from Portsmouth to Nova Scotia . Your rival is the war . Hm ? I have looked at these applications , Lord Kildare , and I shall do what I can . I 'm grateful . There is a favour I must ask in return ... .. if Lady Kildare doesn 't mind . - Have you considered what she did ? - It is done , Father , and can 't be changed . Children are not independent of their parents . She knew that , yet she set her will against mine . You know how she cared for you . - I did everything for her . - I know . I was the best judge of her happiness ! I know ! But she misses you . She didn 't mean to give you pain . - Your behaviour gave me pain . - Mine ? The day after your wedding you visited her . All London spoke of it . There would have been less noise if we 'd lost the fleet ! Father , years have passed . lf punishment were needed , has there not been enough ? - I worry about you . - Do not presume to worry about me . You think to advise me ? You live in lreland ! What can you know ? Father ... .. do you not want to see your eldest grandchild ? Emily , you were a clever child , but it grieves me now to see that you have become a brainless woman ! How dare he speak to you in that manner ? - He can 't understand being crossed . KlLDARE : Richmond is too proud . Pride is natural ... if one 's grandfather was King . And what of his grandmother ? She was the King 's mistress . One of the many he took to bed . And her grandson presumes to be proud ! Royalty issues its own permissions . My family has a legal line for 600 years . Should my wife be insulted by a bastard son ? For God 's sake ! Mr Fox , my husband so hates to see me upset . lndeed I do . We are both grateful to you , Lady Kildare . You did your best . - He will never change now . - I 'm not certain of that . Perhaps the presence of a baby again in his household softened my father 's feelings towards his eldest daughter , Caroline . No , bring her to me . Bring Lady Cecelia to me . A war had been raging between my parents and Caroline for seven years . A war had been raging in Europe for almost as long . This is no way to celebrate winning a war ! - Why should we have rain ? - I trust we did not request it . Rain ! Rain ! We can overcome all else , but who can overcome rain ? Catherine wheels that don 't turn , rockets that don 't shoot and fountains that don 't spray are quite a deal to overcome . The rain is a trifle . No party goes well in the rain ! No party goes well when the party pavilion is burnt to the ground ! This was to have been a night we would never forget . I , for one , will never forget it . The dampest squib of my life . We so wanted a party . I will organise a party , Your Majesty . EMlLY : With peace restored on the Continent , it was time for the family to be reconciled as well . Your generosity , Your Grace , is unequalled in London . My gratitude cannot be expressed . - Mama . - Caroline . Father . Charles . You 've grown so tall . - What are you reading ? - Livy 's History of the Punic Wars . A small memento , Your Grace . Dresden . Thank you . The smallest trifle . To convey our regard . Pray , open it . - A portrait of Lady Caroline . - Yes . To remember her by . Louisa ! You don 't remember me . Are you our sister ? Sarah . Cecelia ? Oh , you ... He 's a fine child for his age . Favours his grandfather , don 't you think ? Thank you . Oh , we like it ... when the wheels go around and the rockets go up ! That is fortunate , Your Majesty , because that is precisely what they 're designed to do . - Do you know everything , Your Grace ? - Your Majesty ? You know about animals , and you know about antiquities . I can 't think how many languages you speak . And here , you know about fireworks ! Yes , they 've turned out well , in design and execution . I think I may say they 've turned out well . Thank you , Your Majesty . A splendid display , Your Grace . lndeed , indeed . Now that the war is over , Mr Fox , you must find yourself less busy . It takes as much effort to get soldiers home as it did to send them out . - You 'll permit me to make a short oration ? - Certainly . Come on . My little girls . Charles . Come forward , Charles . My son and heir . I have here , your most gracious Majesty ... I have my family , my friends , I have my beautiful wife . The most wonderful prize a man ever won . I have my daughter Emily . Where 's Emily ? My daughter , who was married in my house . And Caroline , my daughter who wasn 't . But she is now happily returned to us . All strains are past , all wounds are healed , all injuries forgotten . Henry Fox has acquired the regard of his monarch and his peers . He is being called a great man . And for Caroline 's sake ... l 'm glad . Lord Kildare and Emily have given me two grandchildren already . - Soon there 'll be another ! - Your Grace ! And Charles , my boy ... .. in the fullness of time ... you will take my place . May you be blessed as I have been blessed . You will build on the plenty you inherit . You will travel to Europe , see what it has to offer and know that we can do more . Your Majesty , our country 's influence stretches around the globe . May it extend from east to west through the known and the unknown worlds . May it grow , Your Majesty ! May it grow and grow and ... Argh ! Charles ! No ! Fetch the lawyer . With my father dead , my mother lost her own will to live . I 'll join him before my mourning 's out . I shall ask God to take me . I 'm sure he 'll oblige . She too died within the year . But we were to learn that decrees and principles could still rule from the grave . " This is a final codicil to the will of Sarah , Duchess of Richmond . The bequests thus described have been declared in accordance with my husband 's wishes and his wishes with regard to the guardianship of my remaining children I accede to and relate . My son , Charles Lennox , now Third Duke of Richmond , is the head of the family , but is to continue his education in Europe without interruption . The guardianship of my youngest daughters I give into the care of my daughter ... my daughter Emily . It is my heartfelt desire that no influence may corrupt the morals of my children . I believe my daughter Emily and her husband , Lord Kildare , will ensure their moral and physical well- being until they are of marriageable age . They will then return to London to be presented at court . " " No influence may corrupt the morals of my children " ? This is a slur on you ! My dear , it 's a turn of phrase . He believed a free thinker could have no morals . - What does it matter what he believed ? - I am the elder sister . - Do I not love them as much as you ? - Of course you do . Well , should they be taken to lreland ? - There 's nothing wrong with ... lreland . - It 's not London . - You have not been there ... so do not judge . - However suitable , it is not their home . I believe it will soon become so , Lady Caroline . - It is miles from all they know . - Caroline , don 't . This is Father 's way of revenge . It 's simply his wish . Who knows what he thought ? They will return to us when they are grown . That is no consolation . It 's years away . Emily ... you will let me have them ? I believe we must respect your father 's will . This is between Emily and l . With profound respect , my name is mentioned . - We must think of their good . - I do . Your father 's trust is an honour I did not look for . It 's a duty I will not evade . It might be better not to dispute . Please be assured of our fondest care . No , it is not right . I cannot regard this asjust or fair . I know I cannot alter the written word , I know I cannot bring back the dead , but it is not right ! It is done . We must accept it . It 's done . Having reunited us so recently , my father had split us asunder again . Caroline was hurt and angry . What could we do ? Our parents were dead and beyond the reach of appeal or reason . My sisters , Louisa and Sarah and baby Cecelia , were to be cared for by me in lreland . I think I gave them the childhood my parents would have wished for them . Undoubtedly , theirs would have been a very different upbringing if they had stayed in London with Caroline and Mr Fox . Charles James , that 's enough ! " For Lo ! The board with cups and spoons is crown 'd ! " Bravo ! - He knows one line . - Not at all ! Say five more . - And you 'll grant me a wish ? - Let me hear you first . Meanwhile , declining at the noon of day , The sun obliquely shoots its burning ray . And the hungry judges soon the sentence sign And wretches hang that jurymen may dine . That was four . The bargain is five . No wonder this home is called Liberty Hall for children . Take him down , Henry . Not at all . Come along , Charles James . My nephew Ste had been joined in that household by a younger brother , the precocious Charles James , who was to become more famous than his father . Bravo ! Charles James , come here , my boy . Come along , sit here . Good . Fair and square . Now , what is your wish ? I wish I could bathe in cream . - Cream ? Bathe in cream ! And so you shall , my boy . I believe I denied my younger sisters nothing in lreland . At least I furnished them with a succession of playmates in the pretty shapes of my own children , my ever- increasing brood . Slow down ! You 'll break them . Slow down ! With this ring I thee wed , with my body I thee worship . And with all my worldly goods I ... And with all my worldly goods I thee endow . And now you may kiss the bride . Very good . Now will you read us the rest of the story , Emily ? Yes , Sarah . Come and sit down . Now , where were we ? Often it seemed to me as if Louisa , Sarah and Cecelia were my children rather than my sisters . Sometimes they even called me Mama . My home was theirs , and the years passed in busy happiness . When the time came for Louisa to be married , she did not have to go to London for a husband . I 'd found her a perfectly splendid one in lreland , in the form of Mr Tom Conolly . Nobody could have been more suitable . Damn fine speech you made in parliament last week , Lord Kildare . - Which one , Mr Conolly ? - I can 't remember exactly . The one about m ... mu ... nificent or ... Does not the patriot rejoice in the growth and munificence of his country ? That 's the one ! Our munificence is curtailed . Our taxes go to England . It is a custom which is not just . England won 't give back money . I may have to go to the King himself . I think perhaps you should dance with your wife , Mr Conolly . Good idea . Ready , my lady ? We 'll show 'em how . The success of the match made me begin to consider whom Sarah might marry . And when will you marry , Sarah ? Marry ? - Me ? - Mm . I do not know . But finding a husband for Sarah was going to prove more difficult . - Good night , children . - But , Mama , it 's early ! It is long past your bedtime , George . But they 're still dancing ! I expect they will dance till dawn , but my children must sleep . Go on . And you too , Cecelia . - Good night , sister . - Good night . Oh ! Don 't say you 're hurt ! I 'd die on the spot if you 're hurt . Oh , Tom , what a nice thing to say ! I always go at things . Hunting , dancing , anything . No- one can keep up with you in the country dance . Apart from you . Come on , let 's go home . Where are all my servants ? Get them out of their beds ! And get candles quickly ! My lady must see her house . I have seen your house . Your house , my lady . You are its mistress now . It 's splendid ! I like it so much . You 'll want improvements . Women always want improvements . I want lights in every room ! Morning room , gallery , boudoir , drawing room , library , bedrooms , dressing rooms , er ... blue room , study ... Mr Conolly ! That 's enough ! Enough !

The development of Parliament and Parliamentary institutions was really characterised by a centuries long battle between the executive , in the shape of the King , and the representatives of the people , initially of course on an incredibly narrow franchise , which was widened in the 19th century and then widened again substantially in the 20th Century .

It 's good for maybe home schoolers . " But I didn 't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom . But then I started getting letters from teachers . And the teachers would write , saying , " We use your videos to flip the classroom . You 've given the lectures , so now what we do ... " and this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow , " ... what I do is I assign the lectures for homework . And what used to be homework , I now have the students doing in the classroom . " And I want to pause here for -- ( Applause ) I want to pause here for a second , because there 's a couple of interesting things . One , when those teachers are doing that , there 's the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did . They can pause , repeat at their own pace , at their own time . But the more interesting thing is -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self- paced lecture at home , and then when you go to the classroom , letting them do work , having the teacher walk around , having the peers actually be able to interact with each other , these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom . They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips , not allowed to interact with each other . A teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one size fits all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces , slightly antagonistic -- and now it 's a human experience . Now they 're actually interacting with each other . So once the Khan Academy -- I quit my job and we turned into a real organization -- we 're a not- for- profit -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ? How do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclusion ? And so what I 'm showing you over here , these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins . The ones I started were much more primitive . This is a more competent version of it . But the paradigm here is , we 'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept , until you get 10 in a row . And the Khan Academy videos are there . You get hints , the actual steps for that problem , if you don 't know how to do it . But the paradigm here , it seems like a very simple thing : 10 in a row , you move on . But it 's fundamentally different than what 's happening in classrooms right now . In a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam . And that exam , whether you get a 70 percent , an 80 percent , a 90 percent , or a 95 percent , the class moves on to the next topic . And even that 95 percent student , what was the five percent they didn 't know ? Maybe they didn 't know what happens when you raise something to the zero power . And then you go build on that in the next concept . That 's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle , and maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time , and I give you that bicycle for two weeks . And then I come back after two weeks , and I say , " Well , let 's see . You 're having trouble taking left turns . You can 't quite stop . You 're an 80 percent bicyclist . " So I put a big C stamp on your forehead and then I say , " Here 's a unicycle . " But as ridiculous as that sounds , that 's exactly what 's happening in our classrooms right now . And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden , despite being smart , despite having good teachers . And it 's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation . So our model is learn math the way you 'd learn anything , like the way you would learn a bicycle . Stay on that bicycle . Fall off that bicycle . Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery . The traditional model , it penalizes you for experimentation and failure , but it does not expect mastery . We encourage you to experiment . We encourage you to failure . But we do expect mastery . This is just another one of the modules . This is trigonometry . This is shifting and reflecting functions . And they all fit together . We have about 90 of these right now . And you can go to the site right now . It 's all free . Not trying to sell anything . But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map . That top node right there , that 's literally single digit addition . It 's like one plus one is equal to two . And the paradigm is , once you get 10 in a row on that , it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules . So if you keep further down the knowledge map , we 're getting into more advanced arithmetic . Further down , you start getting into pre- algebra and early algebra . Further down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of precalculus . And the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a framework . So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic , you have computer programming , you have grammar , you have genetics , all based off of that core of , if you know this and that , now you 're ready for this next concept . Now that can work well for an individual learner , and I encourage , one , for you to do it with your kids , but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself . It 'll change what happens at the dinner table . But what we want to do is to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about . And so what I 'm showing you here , this is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district , where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum . These kids aren 't using textbooks , they 're not getting one size fits all lectures . They 're doing Khan Academy , they 're doing that software , for roughly half of their math class . And I want to make it clear , we don 't view this as the complete math education . What it does is -- and this is what 's happening in Los Altos -- it frees up time . This is the blocking and tackling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equations , and it frees up time for the simulations , for the games , for the mechanics , for the robot building , for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow . And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day , every kid works at their own pace -- and this is actually a live dashboard from Los Altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard . Every row is a student . Every column is one of those concepts . Green means the student 's already proficient . Blue means they 're working on it -- no need to worry . Red means they 're stuck . And what the teacher does is literally just say , " Let me intervene on the red kids . " Or even better , " Let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer . " ( Applause ) Now I come from a very data- centric reality , so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : " Oh , what do you not understand ? " or " What do you do understand ? " and all of the rest . So our paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible -- really data that , in almost any other field , is expected , if you 're in finance or marketing or manufacturing . And so the teachers can actually diagnose what 's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible . So now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to , how long they have been spending every day , what videos have they been watching , when did they pause the videos , what did they stop watching , what exercises are they using , what have they been focused on ? The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on . The inner circle shows what videos they 're focused on . And the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong . Red is wrong , blue is right . The leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted . They watched the video right over there . And then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row . It 's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems . They also got faster . The height is how long it took them . So when you talk about self- paced learning , it makes sense for everyone -- in education- speak , differentiated learning -- but it 's kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom . Because every time we 've done this , in every classroom we 've done , over and over again , if you go five days into it , there 's a group of kids who 've raced ahead and there 's a group of kids who are a little bit slower . And in a traditional model , if you did a snapshot assessment , you say , " These are the gifted kids , these are the slow kids . Maybe they should be tracked differently . Maybe we should put them in different classes . " But when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just race ahead . And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago , you now would think are gifted . And we 're seeing it over and over and over again . And it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefitted from were really just due to a coincidence of time . Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos , our goal is to use technology to humanize , not just in Los Altos , but on a global scale , what 's happening in education . And actually , that kind of brings an interesting point . A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student- to- teacher ratios . In our mind , the relevant metric is student- to- valuable- human- time - with- the- teacher ratio . So in a traditional model , most of the teacher 's time is spent giving lectures and grading and whatnot . Maybe five percent of their time is actually sitting next to students and actually working with them . Now 100 percent of their time is . So once again , using technology , not just flipping the classroom , you 're humanizing the classroom , I 'd argue , by a factor of five or 10 . And as valuable as that is in Los Altos , imagine what that does to the adult learner who 's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college . Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta who has to help his family during the day , and that 's the reason why he or she can 't go to school . Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate , or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don 't know . Now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom . But this is all one system . There 's no reason why you can 't have that peer- to- peer tutoring beyond that one classroom . Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your son , or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta ? And I think what you 'll see emerging is this notion of a global one- world classroom . I 've seen some things you 're doing in the system that have to do with with motivation and feedback -- energy points , merit badges . And that 's essentially what we 're trying to build . Thank you . ( Applause ) Bill Gates : Tell me what you 're thinking there ? SK : Oh yeah . No , we have an awesome team working on it . And I have to make it clear , it 's not just me anymore . I 'm still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software . Yeah , we 've put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get these badges , we 're going to start having leader boards by area , and you get points . It 's actually been pretty interesting . Just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something , we see on a system- wide basis , like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another , depending what badge you give them . ( Laughter ) And the collaboration you 're doing with Los Altos , how did that come about ? BG : SK : Los Altos , it was kind of crazy . Once again , I didn 't expect it to be used in classrooms . Someone from their board came and said , " What would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom ? " And I said , " Well , I would just , every student work at their own pace on something like this and we 'd give a dashboard . " And they said , " Oh , this is kind of radical . We have to think about it . " And me and the rest of the team were like , " They 're never going to want to do this . " But literally the next day they were like , " Can you start in two weeks ? " ( Laughter ) BG : So fifth grade math is where that 's going on right now ? SK : It 's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes . And they 're doing it at the district level . I think what they 're excited about is they can now follow these kids . It 's not an only- in- school thing . We 've even , on Christmas , we saw some of the kids were doing it . And we can track everything . So they can actually track them as they go through the entire district . Through the summers , as they go from one teacher to the next , you have this continuity of data that even at the district level they can see . So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what 's going on with those kids . BG : So you 're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need ? SK : Oh yeah . Most of those were specs by the teachers . We made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves . And they 're literally saying , " Hey , this is nice , but ... " Like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , " I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . " So we made that focus diagram . So it 's all been teacher- driven . It 's been pretty crazy . BG : Is this ready for prime- time ? Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ? SK : Yeah , it 's ready . We got a million people on the site already , so we can handle a few more . ( Laughter ) No , no reason why it really can 't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow . BG : And the vision of the tutoring thing . The idea there is , if I 'm confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface I 'd find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and I could schedule and connect up with those people ? SK : Absolutely . And this is something that I recommend everyone in this audience to do . Those dashboards the teachers have , you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids , or nephews , or cousins , or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club . And yeah , you can start becoming a mentor , a tutor , really immediately . But yeah , it 's all there . BG : Well , it 's amazing . I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education . Thank you . ( SK : Thank you . ) ( Applause )

The Government has been elected and its manifesto has therefore been preferred to that of any the other party , and there is an unwritten rule in Parliament that a Government is entitled to get its business .
