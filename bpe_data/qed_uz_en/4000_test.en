You ... you lo@@ se so much !
And they think that means that they are so incre@@ di@@ bly bu@@ s@@ y and produ@@ c@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they 're not , because we , at the moment , have had b@@ ri@@ lli@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ an@@ ce , in poli@@ ti@@ cs , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions .

But it was much less sop@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated and much less organ@@ is@@ ed than it is now .
This is actually from one of the origin@@ al calculus videos . And someone w@@ ro@@ te just on YouTube -- it was a YouTube com@@ ment :
And we think we can make re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation something that everybody can have .
What you see here is a pre@@ ma@@ ture baby .
Thank you .
I 'm making a pro@@ te@@ st .
You know , every vil@@ la@@ ge in B@@ angla@@ de@@ sh and every ham@@ let in Ch@@ in@@ a -- everybody knows : da , da , da , da -- da .
You know , is it ra@@ tional ? I@@ s it logi@@ cal that an@@ ybody should be expe@@ cted to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this E@@ ar@@ th to do .
En@@ ce@@ la@@ du@@ s , seen here .
It couldn 't really end like this , could it ?
And now we need that magi@@ c .
Coca- Cola was inven@@ ted right here in the city of A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta over a 100 years ago . [ music ] B@@ ac@@ k in 18@@ 8@@ 6 , a ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ci@@ st nam@@ ed J@@ oh@@ n P@@ em@@ ber@@ ton was exper@@ im@@ en@@ ting with a new re@@ ci@@ pe .

And that - you know - just because they want to get to those app@@ les , may be the next gener@@ ation .... they keep trying to raise their ne@@ ck , and then after gener@@ ation after gener@@ ation , their ne@@ cks get longer and longer and eventually they turn into gi@@ ra@@ f@@ f@@ es .
F@@ ol@@ lo@@ wing off from H@@ el@@ en ye@@ ster@@ day , this is probably why women are better at multi@@ - tas@@ king . Because you are , ar@@ en 't you ?
This is the pat@@ ter@@ n of pri@@ m@@ es which goes on and on , for@@ ever .
G@@ o home and ask those questions , and then help the people around you .
We don 't know .
But in ad@@ di@@ tion to this , we are also given fin@@ an@@ ce to em@@ plo@@ y our own st@@ af@@ f in order that we can do the re@@ search . We can do the represen@@ tation in the way we think best f@@ its the needs of our local constitu@@ ency and the needs of the country .
And then they re@@ ach the House of Lords . The House of Lords is not du@@ p@@ lic@@ ating what the Commons does , it is actually going over some as@@ pe@@ cts of bil@@ ls which may not have been looked at all .
And one of them came to me the next mor@@ ning and he said ,
M@@ U@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A
It can make war se@@ em like tra@@ ge@@ dy or far@@ ce .
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of ex@@ pla@@ ining the u@@ tter mad@@ den@@ ing ca@@ pri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of the creative process .
So the type of magi@@ c I like , and I 'm a magi@@ ci@@ an , is magi@@ c that uses technology to create il@@ lu@@ sions .
And by the time they get to be adul@@ ts , most kids have lost that ca@@ pac@@ ity .
It is these individu@@ als ac@@ ting as represen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of the people that dri@@ ve Parliament on and help it to re@@ tain re@@ le@@ van@@ ce .
The Ch@@ in@@ ese general S@@ un T@@ z@@ u said that all war was based on de@@ ception .

And re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always did what I loved .
Because they could see I was no longer ser@@ ving them , I was only ser@@ ving myself .
like -- I cha@@ ir the ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y bo@@ ar@@ ds to M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's , and Pe@@ p@@ si@@ C@@ o , and Con@@ A@@ g@@ ra , and S@@ a@@ fe@@ way , and soon

The U@@ K Parliament is made up of three ma@@ in parts : The House of Commons , which is the pri@@ mar@@ y chamber com@@ posed of elected represen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves ;
There 's been a lot of talk about dre@@ ams over the course of these few days .
It 's like , what is simplicity ? One answer would be : because the kin@@ e@@ tic energy of the water m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules is high and they b@@ oun@@ ce aga@@ in@@ st things ra@@ pi@@ dly -- that 's a kind of ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal science ar@@ gu@@ ment .
We are on@@ to something .
While this pressure does not le@@ ad to a con@@ stant st@@ ate of f@@ lu@@ x , the way Parliament is com@@ posed and fun@@ ctions is a continu@@ al work in pro@@ gress .
Then , we col@@ or all the prime numbers b@@ lu@@ e .

Now , I do most of my spe@@ a@@ king in front of an education cro@@ w@@ d -- teachers and students , and I like this an@@ alo@@ gy :
This not only le@@ ts you view Twit@@ ters in different ways , but it in@@ tro@@ du@@ ces new use c@@ ases as well .
I learned that success isn 't a one- way stre@@ et .
- well , I 'm doing my best - that 's the ap@@ e , and may be is also we@@ ar@@ ing a hat and then they show this picture where he slo@@ w@@ ly slo@@ w@@ ly be@@ comes more and more up@@ right and eventually he turns into some du@@ de who is just wal@@ king on his way to work , also just as happy . And now he is wal@@ king completely up@@ right and - you know - there is some kind of im@@ p@@ li@@ cation that wal@@ king up@@ right is better than not wal@@ king up@@ right , and - oh he doesn 't have a ta@@ il any@@ more . Let me e@@ li@@ min@@ ate that .
Just ki@@ d@@ ding .
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as , their c@@ ore w@@ ound is their father di@@ ed without ever saying he 's p@@ rou@@ d of them .
I will leave my mar@@ k so everyone will know
So I su@@ p@@ pose you could multi@@ p@@ ly that by 20 or something to get the number of people who 've seen it .
For better or wor@@ se , we kids ar@@ en 't ham@@ per@@ ed as much when it comes to thinking about reas@@ ons why not to do things .
Every single government de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , and it@@ s nor@@ mal@@ ly about once a month , has to answer questions in the House .
If they do so at the ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate time , the black bo@@ x li@@ ghts up and a p@@ an@@ da be@@ ar p@@ ounds a d@@ ru@@ m .
In fact , we mo@@ ved from S@@ tr@@ at@@ for@@ d to Los An@@ gel@@ es . So you can imagine what a se@@ am@@ less tran@@ si@@ tion that was .
We have a book called the Re@@ gi@@ ster of Mem@@ ber@@ s@@  Inter@@ est@@ s where every Member of Parliament must put down the people who ei@@ ther support them fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally , or if the@@ y@@  have got another job , to put down very c@@ lear@@ ly what that job is and how many h@@ ours they spend on that job and how much money they are paid .
And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me .
We were si@@ tting there and I think they just went out of se@@ qu@@ ence , because we talked to the little boy af@@ ter@@ ward and we said ,
♫ Just going to s@@ we@@ at it out ? ♫ ♫ Just going to s@@ we@@ at it out ? ♫
This we know as '@@ fac@@ tor@@ iz@@ ation . '
But 30 times 40 , instead of you saying , well , this is going to be the same thing as 3 times 4 , but we 're going to put two z@@ er@@ o@@ es at the end of it .
We nee@@ ded something that was por@@ table , something that could be st@@ eri@@ li@@ zed and re@@ used across multi@@ ple babies and something ul@@ tra@@ - lo@@ w@@ - cost , com@@ par@@ ed to the 20@@ , 000 dollars that an in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or in the U@@ . S@@ . co@@ sts .
Why is bin@@ ary simp@@ ler than A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ?
And this is tru@@ ly the most a@@ maz@@ ing thing in the world .
We are very interest@@ ed in deli@@ ver@@ ing heal@@ th care in the develop@@ ing world , and one of the things that we wish to do in this particu@@ lar business is to find a way of doing medi@@ cal di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis at as clo@@ se to z@@ er@@ o cost as we can man@@ age .
When I 'm p@@ ho@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ ing them , I cannot help but remember my g@@ rand@@ father 's le@@ s@@ son .
So we do everything that lea@@ ds up to success , but then we get there .
Th@@ ose are my kids , N@@ at@@ ali@@ e and D@@ a@@ vi@@ d .
So if we want to rou@@ nd , and really we just have two pla@@ ces here , so if we 're going to rou@@ nd anything , it 's going to be to the ne@@ ar@@ est ten because that 's the lar@@ ge@@ st place we have .
Th@@ in@@ k of it . 1@@ , 6@@ 00 people , bu@@ s@@ y people , inv@@ olved in all sor@@ ts of different things ,
This is another way that our mind was shi@@ f@@ ted , and Twitter wasn 't what we thought it was .
So the next time you 're fac@@ ed with something that 's un@@ expe@@ cted , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , consi@@ der that it just may be a gi@@ ft .
And we 're going to be able to inv@@ ent bra@@ in@@ - based inter@@ ven@@ tions for children who have dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty learning .
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same lo@@ cation .
Actually , I kind of divi@@ de the world into two groups now .
You can also have F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation re@@ qu@@ est@@ s when if you do not think that a Minist@@ er is really giving you the kind of detail that you want , you can make a F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation re@@ qu@@ est to find out speci@@ fic deta@@ il@@ s .
I was here .
Re@@ form can be a s@@ low but c@@ ru@@ cial as@@ pe@@ ct of the work of Parliament .
My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ li@@ ons of big ideas that are at the moment dor@@ man@@ t inside us .
We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
So what you 've done is to take a technology , which is a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble ever@@ y@@ where , make a de@@ vice , which is ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely ch@@ ea@@ p , and make it in such a fa@@ shi@@ on that it is very , very re@@ li@@ able .
Now , here come two more people , and im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely after , three more people .
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of writing " E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , Lo@@ ve , " and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of de@@ s@@ pa@@ ir that we all f@@ all into when we 're working on something and it 's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disa@@ ster , the wor@@ st book ever written .
Every M@@ P can sub@@ mit an or@@ al or a written question and the Minist@@ er has to re@@ p@@ ly , ei@@ ther in the chamber or in writing .
And there is no real dist@@ in@@ cti@@ ven@@ ess of your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else 's con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Why do so many people re@@ ach success and then fa@@ il ?
I 'm not sure you 'd want it .
The first was , instead of the months fl@@ ying by , for@@ go@@ tten , the time was much more me@@ mor@@ able .
They get no great ple@@ as@@ ure from what they do . They en@@ du@@ re it rather than en@@ joy it , and wa@@ it for the we@@ ek@@ end .
Yes , my an@@ ge@@ l , it 's all in order .
The reason is because in the first month of a baby 's life , its only job is to grow .
These technolo@@ gi@@ es , com@@ bin@@ ed with the ex@@ tra@@ ordinary tal@@ ents of teachers , provi@@ de an opport@@ un@@ ity to re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ iz@@ e education .
Well , Mr C@@ and@@ ler thought that was a per@@ fec@@ tly stu@@ pi@@ d idea .
These are ans@@ w@@ ers to or@@ al questions that have been s@@ ent to me by Minist@@ ers .
looking , as she put it " for another po@@ et . " And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would almost mi@@ ss it , right ? So , she 's run@@ ning to the house and she 's looking for the pa@@ per and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her , and she gra@@ b@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it 's going through her , and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it .

" We 're going to start pu@@ tting them on@@ line . Can we put your@@ s on@@ line ? "
No@@ body has a c@@ lu@@ e , de@@ sp@@ ite all the exper@@ ti@@ se that 's been on para@@ de for the past four days , what the world will look like in five years ' time .
Thank you .
I couldn 't come up with any ideas .
We de@@ cei@@ ve to ga@@ in ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge and to hi@@ de our we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses .
Or we can z@@ o@@ om out to the table of con@@ t@@ ents , and the video ke@@ e@@ ps playing .
It comes from Parliament itself too when we want to re@@ stri@@ ct the number of constitu@@ en@@ cies there are , ther@@ e@@ by re@@ stri@@ cting the number of Members of Parliament .
You probably had no idea .

Let 's play a g@@ ame .

If you find what you e@@ at hon@@ est@@ ly , then you live ful@@ fil@@ ling , sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying life .
F@@ i@@ ve years ago you had an idea .
There are also written questions and you can write le@@ t@@ ters to Minist@@ ers and they are ob@@ lig@@ ed to respon@@ d .
If you could not per@@ su@@ a@@ de the House of Lords then they effec@@ ti@@ vely had a right of ve@@ to .
Now these are not elec@@ tion re@@ turns , these are the people -- the number of the people who are o@@ be@@ se by st@@ ate , be@@ gin@@ ning in '@@ 8@@ 5 , ' 8@@ 6 , '@@ 8@@ 7 -- these are from the C@@ D@@ C we@@ b@@ site -- ' 8@@ 8 , '@@ 8@@ 9 , '@@ 9@@ 0 , '@@ 9@@ 1 -- you get a new cat@@ e@@ g@@ or@@ y -- ' 9@@ 2 , '@@ 9@@ 3 , '@@ 9@@ 4 , '@@ 9@@ 5 , '@@ 9@@ 6 ,

In@@ spi@@ red by this story , and do@@ z@@ ens of other si@@ mi@@ lar stor@@ i@@ es like this , my te@@ am and I reali@@ zed what was nee@@ ded was a local s@@ olution , something that could work without electri@@ city , that was simple enough for a mother or a mi@@ d@@ wife to use , given that the maj@@ ority of bir@@ ths still take place in the home .

A thir@@ d is that I wanted ho@@ t water for te@@ a -- that 's an in@@ tenti@@ on@@ al ar@@ gu@@ ment .
Every M@@ P can sub@@ mit an or@@ al or a written question and the Minist@@ er has to re@@ p@@ ly , ei@@ ther in the chamber or in writing .
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts repor@@ t that 19@@ 9@@ 8 was the war@@ me@@ st year in me@@ as@@ u@@ red history , with 200@@ 5 coming in second .
O@@ n this ma@@ p , every country that 's col@@ or@@ ed b@@ lu@@ e has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
This is a room of sle@@ e@@ p@@ - de@@ pri@@ ved women .
This is an inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tional technology , but , in c@@ lin@@ i@@ cal tri@@ als , we 're seeing a 4@@ 4 to 6@@ 4 percent de@@ cre@@ ase in ch@@ ron@@ ic pain p@@ ati@@ ents .
So , how do you do i@@ mi@@ tation ?
So I went to a library . I read books , science books , espe@@ ci@@ ally ph@@ y@@ si@@ cs .
What about a life ?
Ta@@ ke care of yourself my child , don 't get ex@@ ha@@ ust@@ ed . Ma@@ king money doesn 't run away , you are still young .

O@@ ver a 100 years later , the for@@ mu@@ la is still a clo@@ sel@@ y gu@@ ar@@ ded se@@ cre@@ t .
We are con@@ stan@@ tly looking to impro@@ ve ; building on the posi@@ tive and learning from ne@@ ga@@ tive experi@@ en@@ ces .
And then they re@@ pac@@ ka@@ ge them and sel@@ l them out on mar@@ ke@@ ts for literally more money than a ster@@ ile sy@@ rin@@ ge in the first place , which is quite biz@@ ar@@ re .
We can do the same for ge@@ o@@ ther@@ mal energy and so@@ lar power .
How can we have world pe@@ ac@@ e with different cul@@ tures , different langu@@ ages ?
S@@ ome@@ times a know@@ le@@ dge of history and the past fa@@ il@@ u@@ res of U@@ top@@ i@@ an ide@@ als can be a bur@@ den , because you know that if everything were free , then the fo@@ od st@@ oc@@ ks would become de@@ ple@@ ted and sc@@ ar@@ ce and le@@ ad to cha@@ os .
And that stru@@ g@@ g@@ le has been the de@@ f@@ ining the@@ me of the way in which the Parliament of today is what it is . Parliament in this country is well est@@ ab@@ lish@@ ed but the history has not exactly been s@@ mo@@ o@@ th .
And so it@@  is very important to me that I go and see them and make the case why it is that I am not going to vo@@ te a certain way that they want me to vo@@ te .
We got that z@@ er@@ o , so let 's sti@@ ck that z@@ er@@ o there , and then we got that b@@ lu@@ e z@@ er@@ o there , so let 's put that over there .
I find this very interesting .
In the House of Commons a small committee will look at the detail line by line .
They s@@ qu@@ ir@@ t them at each other , which is lo@@ vely and in@@ no@@ cent .
" As our case is new , so we must think an@@ e@@ w and ac@@ t an@@ e@@ w .
There is only one Coca- Cola .
You know , I was thinking about that guy recently , just a few minutes ago when you were spe@@ a@@ king , about this teacher , because six months ago , I sa@@ ved his life . "

But it can bu@@ y P@@ ro@@ za@@ c . "
Then again , who 's to say that certain ty@@ pes of ir@@ ra@@ tional thinking ar@@ en 't exactly what the world needs ?
So , here you have my last sli@@ de .
And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then impro@@ ved them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
Or look at the for@@ ei@@ gn word and the sounds : can you get a sense of the ran@@ ge of me@@ an@@ ings that it 's poin@@ ting you to@@ war@@ ds ?
If you really want to ex@@ i@@ st , come back at a more opport@@ un@@ e moment when I can take care of you .
I 've seen inside my brain .
You can say that .
When I ga@@ ve up su@@ gar for 30 days , day 3@@ 1 looked like this .
