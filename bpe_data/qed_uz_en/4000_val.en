I was here .
J@@ o@@ e K@@ ra@@ us says ,

local com@@ mun@@ ity c@@ am@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ers , who are what we call good constitu@@ ency MPs .
We don 't need radi@@ ation .
And I also repor@@ ted that we 'd made this min@@ d- blo@@ wing dis@@ co@@ very -- this on@@ ce@@ - in@@ - a@@ - li@@ fe@@ time dis@@ co@@ very of to@@ wer@@ ing j@@ ets er@@ up@@ ting from those f@@ ra@@ c@@ tures at the s@@ outh p@@ ole , con@@ sist@@ ing of tin@@ y water ice c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by water va@@ p@@ or and simple organi@@ c comp@@ ounds like car@@ b@@ on di@@ oxi@@ de and me@@ th@@ an@@ e .
But ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally ne@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s , radi@@ o , tel@@ evi@@ sion and new medi@@ a have ac@@ cess to Parliament in order to talk to MPs , inter@@ view MPs , give MPs a pla@@ t@@ form for their views , but also to hold MPs accoun@@ table for the things they have done , and for the vo@@ tes they have parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent neurons for different lo@@ ca@@ tions .
So what we need to do now is put those two pi@@ c@@ tures together in our mind -- something like this .
If my wife is co@@ o@@ king a me@@ al at home -- which is not often , th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly .
So , 15 minutes left . ( Laughter ) Well , I was bor@@ n ... no .

The book starts like this .
These are called mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
So what one is interest@@ ed in has a lot to do with the re@@ war@@ ds of the system .
And what was so sa@@ d about this particu@@ lar story was that once their parents had found out -- and don 't for@@ get , their parents took them to the doc@@ tor -- the parents th@@ re@@ w them out on the stre@@ et .
" I 've list@@ en@@ ed to all these things your mother 's told me , I need to speak to her pri@@ v@@ at@@ ely . We 'll be back ; we won 't be very long , " and they went and left her . Wa@@ it here . But as they went out of the room , he turned on the radi@@ o that was si@@ tting on his de@@ s@@ k .
And great creativity is nee@@ ded to do what it does so well : to pro@@ vo@@ ke us to think differ@@ en@@ tly with dra@@ mati@@ c creative st@@ at@@ e@@ ments .
But that does not mean that we have to a@@ gree with everything that our constituents tell us .
It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under .

Then , one day a couple of cle@@ ver gu@@ ys nam@@ ed Th@@ o@@ mas and Wh@@ it@@ e@@ head had an idea .

I heard a great story recently -- I love tel@@ ling it -- of a little gir@@ l who was in a dra@@ wing le@@ s@@ son . She was six , and she was at the back , dra@@ wing , and the teacher said this gir@@ l har@@ dly ever paid at@@ tention , and in this dra@@ wing le@@ s@@ son , she did . The teacher was f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated .
But if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , " What do you do ? " and you say you work in education , you can see the blo@@ od run from their face . They 're like , " Oh my God , " you know , " Why me ? "
Sh@@ are your in@@ spi@@ ring dre@@ am with them .
And in the M@@ R@@ I and M@@ R spe@@ c@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y here , the pro@@ st@@ ate tu@@ m@@ or acti@@ vity is sh@@ own in red -- you can see it di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing after a year .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly , we have a new ma@@ ch@@ ine , mag@@ ne@@ to@@ en@@ cep@@ ha@@ lo@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , that allo@@ ws us to do this .
What actually happened was the im@@ pul@@ ses were re@@ du@@ ced .

M@@ M :

An@@ y Member of our House can bring forward an issu@@ e that they wish to have dis@@ cu@@ ssed or debat@@ ed .
So no@@ body is t@@ one- de@@ a@@ f .
And because of that an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ement , we got a big arti@@ cle in The Ne@@ w Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es , which led to more pre@@ ss , which led to more at@@ tention , and me deci@@ ding to become C@@ E@@ O of that company -- wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I was just an ad@@ vi@@ ser -- and ra@@ is@@ ing a rou@@ nd of ven@@ ture ca@@ pi@@ tal and ra@@ mp@@ ing up hi@@ ring .
