Be@@ fore that time ,
Now , before we start -- ( Laughter ) Be@@ fore we start , I need to do two things .

The House of Lords , the ap@@ poin@@ ted chamber char@@ g@@ ed with am@@ en@@ ding and re@@ vi@@ sing legislation , and the Mon@@ arch , who is the H@@ e@@ ad of St@@ ate .

D@@ o@@ esn 't matter where you go . You 'd think it would be otherwise , but it isn 't . At the top are mathematics and langu@@ ages , then the human@@ i@@ ties , and at the bot@@ tom are the ar@@ ts .

At the end of the day the Government is the ser@@ v@@ ant of Parliament , not the other way around .
I w@@ ro@@ te over 300 short stor@@ i@@ es on that little laptop , and I wanted to get publish@@ ed .

One of the real challen@@ ges is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate fundamen@@ tally in education .
Con@@ stitu@@ ents seek to influence MPs by writing to their Members of Parliament on issues of im@@ portan@@ ce to them . They could be policy issues , not just about d@@ om@@ es@@ tic policy but con@@ cer@@ ns , for example , about what is happening in other parts of the world like the Mi@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st .
It i@@ s one way that a M@@ P can hold the government to account and really get to the bot@@ tom of certain issues that you cannot always raise in the chamber .
What 's new is that that process has ty@@ pi@@ cally tak@@ en days or months of an@@ al@@ y@@ sis .
You take the b@@ lu@@ e p@@ ill , the story ends , you wa@@ ke up in your b@@ ed , and you believe whatever you want to believe .
O@@ ther ones have a focus on heal@@ th care , tou@@ ri@@ sm , engin@@ e@@ er@@ ing and other fi@@ el@@ ds .
And for the future , it won 't ser@@ ve us . We have to re@@ think the fundamen@@ tal p@@ rin@@ ci@@ ples on which we 're edu@@ c@@ ating our children .

It 's the doing that gi@@ ves so much ple@@ as@@ ure .
And it is good that we have some of the tradi@@ tions and symbo@@ li@@ sm of past years ; for example , the St@@ ate O@@ pen@@ ing of Parliament by the Qu@@ een in the House of Lords .
Then it 's ri@@ pe for our lu@@ ck to turn .
W@@ ri@@ ting books is my profes@@ sion but it 's more than that , of course .
This is , ob@@ viously , that f@@ am@@ ous view now of the Ar@@ c@@ tic , which is likely to be g@@ one at this point in the next three or four or five years . V@@ er@@ y , very , very sc@@ ary .

To find these repe@@ ti@@ tive pat@@ ter@@ ns , we look to@@ war@@ ds the he@@ av@@ ens .

You 've got to pu@@ sh through sh@@ y@@ ness and sel@@ f- d@@ ou@@ b@@ t .
So I deci@@ ded to do something about it .
Th@@ ir@@ d is house number three . It 's e@@ asy .
And when you give yourself over to that de@@ ception , it be@@ comes magi@@ c .
It is a very different system but we still dra@@ w a dist@@ in@@ ction because al@@ though the me@@ m@@ bers of Government are Members of Parliament ,
And so it@@  is very important to me that I go and see them and make the case why it is that I am not going to vo@@ te a certain way that they want me to vo@@ te .
And the answer is , simply , that if I hold up three f@@ ing@@ ers , you can coun@@ t that ea@@ si@@ ly , but if I hold up this , it 's sort of hard to say that I just did seven .
And one of them said , " Because we were list@@ ening . " ( Laughter )
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , re@@ ad@@ ings tak@@ en from ice cor@@ es show that the gre@@ en@@ house g@@ ases car@@ b@@ on di@@ oxi@@ de and me@@ th@@ an@@ e have h@@ it their high@@ est value in the last 4@@ 20@@ , 000 years .

Ma@@ gi@@ c is the only hon@@ est profes@@ sion .
And this began to get a head of ste@@ am .
I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ cei@@ ve education .
And he 's dri@@ ving it all with this pla@@ t@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ - f@@ ing@@ er key@@ bo@@ ard and the world 's first computer m@@ ouse , which he speci@@ ally de@@ sig@@ ned in order to do this system .

So , em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ e , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , otherwise you 'll get con@@ fu@@ sed and mu@@ d@@ d@@ led . "
And in pretty much every system too , there 's a hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y within the ar@@ ts .
We are em@@ bar@@ king on a g@@ r@@ and and g@@ ol@@ den age of know@@ le@@ dge about child 's brain development .
" I 'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids . "
And the A@@ vi@@ an F@@ l@@ u is also not a good idea .

Maybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent underst@@ anding about the rela@@ tion@@ ship between human@@ s and the creative my@@ stery .
He gets to E , but it 's the wrong chor@@ d .
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens , but too often , it 's not .
There is now a kind of sleep de@@ pri@@ vation one- up@@ man@@ ship .
And we have seen that in all political par@@ ties now .
M@@ any people , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y .
( Laughter ) And this is how people thought about creativity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And if not , of course to op@@ pose it , to speak out and to say that it can@@ @@ not go along with it but to do it , of course , in a de@@ mo@@ cra@@ tic man@@ ner .
What I think it comes to is this :

And , since this is coming from a mor@@ al ph@@ ilo@@ sop@@ her , the f@@ our@@ th would be that it 's part of God 's p@@ lan for the uni@@ ver@@ se .
So , I 'm saying the mir@@ ror neuron system under@@ li@@ es the inter@@ face allo@@ wing you to re@@ think about issues like con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , represen@@ tation of self , what se@@ par@@ ates you from other human beings , what allo@@ ws you to em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ e with other human beings , and also even things like the em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of cul@@ ture and ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ation , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human beings .

Hey son , come here .
And probably the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le for education is getting you to colle@@ ge .
Un@@ der@@ l@@ ying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers learn best by doing things , they learn best in te@@ ams and they learn best by doing things for real -- all the op@@ posi@@ te of what ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am scho@@ ol@@ ing actually does .
Then it goes back to the Commons , to look at again .
S@@ ci@@ ence is cle@@ ver , but great creativity is something less know@@ able , more magi@@ cal .
And so we have this symbo@@ li@@ sm ; the symbo@@ li@@ sm of the S@@ pe@@ a@@ ker@@  's pro@@ c@@ es@@ sion every day through C@@ en@@ tra@@ l L@@ ob@@ by and most im@@ portan@@ tly , the car@@ r@@ ying of the ma@@ ce .
And you put lots of them together and you come with something called in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed circu@@ its . And a cur@@ r@@ ent in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed circu@@ it might have in each one of these chi@@ ps something like a bil@@ li@@ on tran@@ si@@ stor@@ s , all of which have to work per@@ fec@@ tly every time .
I mean , the syst@@ ems work , and we have to find out how to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture them and do things of this kind , but the basi@@ c technology works .
And I would p@@ lea@@ se like the recor@@ d to re@@ fle@@ ct today that I sho@@ wed up for my part of the job . " ( Laughter )
But I wouldn 't change my experience .
F@@ our years ago , on the TED st@@ age ,
I can see it in their eyes .
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fi@@ el@@ ds . It was the future I couldn 't accep@@ t .
Now , the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you . There are 1@@ , 6@@ 00 people , I believe .
What TED cel@@ e@@ br@@ ates is the gi@@ ft of the human i@@ ma@@ gin@@ ation . We have to be car@@ e@@ ful now that we use this gi@@ ft wi@@ sel@@ y and that we a@@ ver@@ t some of the s@@ cen@@ ari@@ os that we 've talked about . And the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative ca@@ pac@@ i@@ ties for the ri@@ ch@@ ness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are .
What materi@@ als did you use ?
We 're cul@@ tu@@ re- b@@ ound list@@ en@@ ers .

So how does electri@@ city i@@ g@@ n@@ ite re@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al fi@@ res ?
I also noti@@ ced that as I started to do more and har@@ der 30@@ - day challen@@ ges , my sel@@ f- con@@ fi@@ dence gre@@ w .
Why is that important ?
S@@ ome@@ times , constituents hold very different poin@@ ts of view to me .
And I said , " S@@ ure . "
They 're not like all of you who can sit in ro@@ ws and hear things said to you for hour after hour .
And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day .
And at that time two years ago I men@@ tion@@ ed that we were spe@@ cu@@ la@@ ting that these j@@ ets might in fact be ge@@ y@@ s@@ ers , and er@@ up@@ ting from po@@ cke@@ ts or cha@@ m@@ bers of li@@ qu@@ id water under@@ ne@@ ath the sur@@ face , but we wer@@ en 't really sure .
And if you 're doing the thing that you love to do , that you 're good at , time takes a different course entirely .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in ac@@ tion in the late 8@@ 0@@ s .
No idea how this may play out .
And then again in the House of Commons , which would be said by all MPs , that they are elected and so have the man@@ da@@ te to represent the w@@ ish@@ es , to some ex@@ tent , of their constituents .
There 's also a f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating conne@@ ction to can@@ cer here , because people with ne@@ uro@@ logi@@ c dise@@ ases have a very low in@@ ci@@ dence of most can@@ c@@ ers .
One of the great things of course is that we are not ci@@ vi@@ l ser@@ van@@ ts , we are ser@@ van@@ ts of the legisla@@ ture , not of the ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive and so that inde@@ pen@@ dence , whether one is ser@@ ving a select committee or one of our really top gra@@ de re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ers de@@ con@@ stru@@ cting un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment statistics , they are not doing it under any min@@ ist@@ eri@@ al dire@@ ction , they are doing it for the House of Commons .
You see , the first time , he was playing with an im@@ pul@@ se on every no@@ te .
And so we try to ask :
And I 'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong sum@@ mit of the p@@ y@@ ra@@ mi@@ d ... that the cor@@ re@@ ct sum@@ mit -- that all of our students , every high school gra@@ du@@ ate should know -- should be statistics : pro@@ ba@@ bility and statistics .
Al@@ right , son ? !
So first , if you are the type , like the shir@@ t@@ less dan@@ cing guy that is st@@ anding al@@ one , remember the im@@ portan@@ ce of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing your first few follo@@ w@@ ers as equ@@ als so it 's c@@ lear@@ ly about the movement , not you . ( Laughter )

The 1@@ 0@@ - year- old , on every eight no@@ tes .
And the way I got interest@@ ed in this was , I noti@@ ced in myself , when I was gro@@ wing up , and until about a few years ago , that I would want to say thank you to someone , I would want to pra@@ ise them ,

And many of our ideas have been for@@ med , not to meet the circum@@ stances of this century , but to c@@ op@@ e with the circum@@ stances of pre@@ vious cen@@ tu@@ ries .

E@@ d : H@@ el@@ l@@ o , everyone . Good ev@@ ening . I 'd like to w@@ el@@ come you to the - ( laughter ) The M@@ l@@ T C@@ lu@@ b of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a . T@@ oni@@ ght , we have an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent , dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ ed spe@@ ak@@ er , but before we in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce him , I hope you have en@@ joy@@ ed the san@@ d@@ wi@@ ches and co@@ o@@ ki@@ es . We learned to make those our@@ selves by watching one of Sal 's videos . ( laughter ) Just ki@@ d@@ ding , they 're from S@@ u@@ b@@ way . ( laughter ) Let me read a bi@@ o for Sal . Sal is a social en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur who has become an inter@@ net sen@@ sa@@ tion and in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion for his fun and high@@ ly effec@@ tive edu@@ ca@@ tional videos on YouTube . Every month , more than 1@@ 00@@ , 000 students , both young and old , across the g@@ lo@@ be , use his over 1@@ , 300 free videos to learn about ari@@ th@@ me@@ ti@@ cs , fin@@ an@@ ce , che@@ mist@@ ry , ( unintelligible ) calculus . He foun@@ ded the Khan Academy , which was recently cover@@ ed on C@@ N@@ N , P@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , N@@ P@@ R , S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o Ch@@ ron@@ i@@ cle , and N@@ B@@ C N@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ line . H@@ is missi@@ on is nothing short of cre@@ ating a free and world class vir@@ tual school for an@@ yone in the world . He will speak about his experience starting the aca@@ demy and ma@@ ssi@@ vely trans@@ forma@@ tional changes in learning and teaching . ( unintelligible ) in the next five to ten years . Sal gra@@ du@@ ated from M@@ l@@ T in 19@@ 9@@ 8 with computer science and math de@@ gre@@ es and re@@ cei@@ ved his M@@ B@@ A from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Bu@@ sin@@ ess S@@ cho@@ ol . He left his day job as a he@@ dge fun@@ d an@@ al@@ y@@ st in 200@@ 9 to de@@ di@@ c@@ ated ful@@ l time to his n@@ on- prof@@ it aca@@ demy . We 're deli@@ gh@@ ted and hon@@ or@@ ed to have this dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ ed spe@@ ak@@ er t@@ oni@@ ght , an em@@ er@@ g@@ ing gi@@ ant in the on@@ line education sp@@ ac@@ e , a worl@@ d- class edu@@ cat@@ or , a d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ c com@@ muni@@ cat@@ or , and a sel@@ f@@ less go@@ od@@ - do@@ er , S@@ al@@ man Khan . ( app@@ lause ) Sal : Can you all hear me ? I 'd pre@@ f@@ er to just be clo@@ ser to you all , than ... Can you hear me in the back ? Okay , co@@ ol . Just like E@@ d said , I 'm Sal , the foun@@ der and fac@@ ul@@ ty of the Khan Academy . ( laughter ) This is - I really want to make this - I think this will be a fun conversa@@ tion . I don 't want this to be me at the Po@@ wer@@ Po@@ in@@ t for the whole hour . I really want you all to inter@@ ru@@ pt me or raise your hand , ask me questions , and we can take this wh@@ er@@ ever we want to go , because there 's really a couple of different conversa@@ tions we can have and maybe we can have them all . How many of you all have wat@@ ched a Khan Academy video ? Okay , that 's a pretty good co@@ ver . Just so you know what it is , and actually , maybe to get a sense , of the gro@@ w@@ th . E@@ d said 1@@ 00@@ , 000 and when he first asked me it was 1@@ 00@@ , 000 , now it 's 200@@ , 000 uni@@ qu@@ e students a month and it 's only been two months . It is the fa@@ ste@@ st gro@@ wing open course ef@@ for@@ t . Now , it 's actually pas@@ sed up - I 'm not - Well , I 'm a little compe@@ ti@@ tive . It pas@@ sed up M@@ l@@ T recently , in terms of ( laughter ) being the most used . It 's getting about 6@@ 0 or 7@@ 0@@ , 000 video views a day . It has clo@@ sed to 16 million views on YouTube . One of the things we can talk about is maybe why . It might be something about the con@@ tent , how it 's deli@@ ver@@ ed and wha@@ t@@ not . We can talk about all of that . This is the site , just for those of you all who have never seen it . We can also de@@ b@@ ate my us@@ er inter@@ face skills for just pu@@ tting all 1@@ , 4@@ 00 lin@@ ks ( laughter ) on one page . Th@@ ose are the videos and if you cli@@ ck on a random video , if you want a re@@ view of ( unintelligible ) you can cli@@ ck there . We can let it lo@@ ad up or whatever . That 's the Khan Academy . What I want to do - ( unintelligible ) I@@ s there sound ? The sound isn 't any different than what you 're he@@ ar@@ ing right now . ( laughter ) You see this and you hear my vo@@ ice and you don 't see me . This 'll give you a f@@ la@@ v@@ or for the form fac@@ tor . That could be a conversa@@ tion we could have about why this is an interesting form fac@@ tor and why I did it and all of that type of thing . What I 'm going to focus on , because I think most people are fa@@ mi@@ li@@ ar with the video library . It has this re@@ ach , it 's go@@ tten pop@@ ular , it 's gro@@ wing 10 or 15 % a month at this point . I want to talk about the big@@ ger vi@@ sion . E@@ d has talked about this idea of starting a vir@@ tual school for the world and ob@@ viously , videos are a start . They 're the lecture part of a school , but a real school 's got to be more than just video . You have to have some interaction with other people , you have to have pra@@ cti@@ ce , you have to have assessment , you have to have data and all of these things . That 's what I want to talk about and I 'm gener@@ ally open to ideas , because this is a work in pro@@ gress . Some of it is starting to be built . H@@ op@@ ef@@ ully over the next few months it 'll be built in a much big@@ ger way . Some v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers have come out of the w@@ o@@ od@@ work very recently to su@@ per@@ char@@ ge some of these ef@@ for@@ ts . It 's exc@@ iting times . Let me get the presen@@ tation up . A good number of you all saw the videos . How many of you all saw the we@@ b appli@@ cation on the site ? Okay , that 's a much lo@@ wer pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tion r@@ ate . Just so you all know a little bit of the history , and I 'm happy to go into this as much as you want , but I started doing this re@@ mo@@ tely tu@@ tor@@ ing , because I was in Bo@@ st@@ on , my cousins were in Ne@@ w O@@ r@@ le@@ ans , and she was having trouble with un@@ its and I said , " Hey , after your school and my work let 's get together vir@@ tually . " We 'll use Ya@@ ho@@ o D@@ o@@ od@@ le , it 'll be a shar@@ ed no@@ tepa@@ d " that we can each see what each other is writing . " I got her a little W@@ ac@@ om p@@ en ta@@ b@@ let , I had one for myself . We 'd just do con@@ ference cal@@ ls and that 's how I started . Then she started doing really well , then I started tu@@ tor@@ ing her bro@@ thers , other cousins . Then a couple of things happened and I usu@@ ally go stra@@ ight to the videos , because that 's what it 's known for , but being a computer science ge@@ ek , I didn 't even think of doing the videos at first . I said , " Hey , you know what , I 'm going to write so@@ ft - I would give them these little lec@@ tures and I would just point them to random we@@ b@@ si@@ tes , like , " Hey , there 's a co@@ ol app@@ let on that we@@ b@@ site over there . " Why don 't you try it out and tell me tomorrow whether you underst@@ o@@ od , " whether you 're able to do those exerci@@ ses , or use that we@@ b@@ site over there , " I just got really f@@ ru@@ st@@ rat@@ ed , this pi@@ ece@@ me@@ al we@@ b@@ site here , we@@ b@@ site there , so I said , " I 'm going to write a couple of j@@ av@@ as@@ cri@@ pt , " little things that 'll gener@@ ate problems for them . " It 's not just ten problems and it may come up with some random numbers and give them as many problems as they need . I made a bun@@ ch of these modules . I 'll show you what the modules look like . This is like a multi@@ pl@@ ying deci@@ ma@@ ls mo@@ du@@ le and we can go into as much de@@ p@@ th on these as you want . I started making these little j@@ av@@ as@@ cri@@ pt modules for them and it was starting really where she was , at un@@ its and basi@@ c algebra and ad@@ ding and sub@@ tra@@ cting ne@@ ga@@ tive numbers , and basi@@ c lin@@ e@@ ar equ@@ ations and then I said , " Ge@@ e , you know , I don 't trust - I 'd say , " Hey , Na@@ dia , did you do the problems ? " How many did you do ? " and she 's like , " Oh yeah , I did them ( unintelligible ) ( laughter ) I was like , " I 'm going to put a da@@ ta@@ ba@@ se be@@ hin@@ d this thing . " I put a da@@ ta@@ ba@@ se be@@ hin@@ d it so I could keep tra@@ ck of when she did the problem , how long was it taking her , how many times was she doing , how fre@@ qu@@ en@@ tly was she getting one right or one wrong . Then I started making them up . O@@ n that first sli@@ de right there , each of these cir@@ c@@ les is a mo@@ du@@ le , and literally , the first mo@@ du@@ le - This was a very organi@@ c process . It was really just me working with my cousins and it@@ er@@ ating , saying it would be nice to have the data . Then , I started making modules here one off and I would at first just point them to it . Then after a while , I was like , there 's some kind of de@@ pen@@ den@@ cy here , because Na@@ dia got that , but she needs help with that , so to f@@ ill in that gap , let me make another mo@@ du@@ le . Then , after a while , I got ti@@ red of having to as@@ sign the modules , so I said , " Well , it should au@@ to@@ mati@@ cally as@@ sign the modules , " because once she gets ten in a row in this , " she 's ready for this , this , and this . " So , I cre@@ ated this inter@@ nal de@@ pen@@ den@@ cy in the little ap@@ p to do this and I said , " Well , this is kind of a ne@@ at gra@@ p@@ h . " This is what I was using just to keep tra@@ ck of the modules , I should just ex@@ pose this to the students , so they know what 's going on . This is the ap@@ p and this started well before I made the first video , but it 's kind of like the se@@ cre@@ t of the Khan Academy , so you 're getting a little ti@@ d@@ bit . But I think it 's also the future on a lot of le@@ vel@@ s . So this right here , this is literally level one ad@@ di@@ tion , so it 's literally 1@@ +@@ 1 . If you go to the we@@ b@@ site , there is literally a video on 1@@ +@@ 1 and at first , it 's almost a jo@@ ke that I made the video on ad@@ ding 1@@ +@@ 1 , but the whole idea be@@ hin@@ d it , be@@ si@@ des being cu@@ te , is to give people the no@@ tion that no matter how basi@@ c your skills , you can go to this site and you will find something that f@@ its your need and the idea that you can , when you see 1@@ +@@ 1 on the same page as v@@ ec@@ tor calculus , you 're like , " Ge@@ e , I just have to ste@@ p through that thing and I can get to v@@ ec@@ tor calculus . " There 's not some my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous - ( laughter ) " And it 's the same du@@ de who 's going to take me through the - ( laughter ) " My K@@ in@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teacher is teaching me v@@ ec@@ tor calculus . " ( laughter ) You get ten in a row and - On@@ ce this was made , then it started to make - This became what a lot of people in education talk about , differ@@ enti@@ ated learning , with data and all of that , but it made me pa@@ use and say , " This is working for my cousins , " but there was actually one piece that was mi@@ ss@@ ing and that was the - I still had to do - When I first started it , I thought - It rand@@ om@@ ly gener@@ ated these problems and pi@@ c@@ ked random numbers here and then when you c@@ lic@@ ked hin@@ t , it would show you the exac@@ t ste@@ ps for that problem . I was like , " Oh , that 's all you need to learn how to do a problem . " You just need the exac@@ t ste@@ ps for that exac@@ t problem . " This 'll work for my cousins . " But it didn 't . It would help them if they kind of knew how to multi@@ p@@ ly deci@@ ma@@ ls already , but it didn 't get them over that hur@@ d@@ le . I still had to do that one- on- one ses@@ sion with them re@@ mo@@ tely . That became hard to scal@@ e . L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , another bu@@ d@@ dy from M@@ l@@ T , we were at din@@ ner and he 's like , " Why don 't you make YouTube videos ? " The thing that you do with your cousins , " why don 't you just recor@@ d that on YouTube ? " I was completely dis@@ missi@@ ve of the idea . I was like , " Oh , that 's so sil@@ ly , I have this software . " It gener@@ ates problems d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cally , ( laughter ) " it 's got hin@@ ts , what 's a YouTube video going to do ? " He 's like , " Yeah , you 're right , it 's probably a stu@@ pi@@ d idea . " ( laughter ) I went home and I was like , " Well , maybe there 's something to it . " L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , when I ke@@ pt recor@@ ding videos with my cousins , I would do the ten@@ th lecture on ne@@ ga@@ tive numbers with a new cou@@ sin , I was like , " Yeah , maybe a YouTube video will make sense . " I made the first YouTube video on gre@@ at@@ est com@@ mon divi@@ s@@ or and this and that and then - I 've said this in tal@@ ks before , the im@@ medi@@ ate feedback I got from my cousins was that , " You are better on YouTube than you are live . " ( laughter ) The point , I think , that he was trying to com@@ muni@@ c@@ ate is it had n@@ one of the pressure of a traditional tu@@ tor@@ ing ses@@ sion . " D@@ id you get this ? " and you 're star@@ ing at the person . They 're like , " Yeah , maybe I did , " ( laughter ) and they 're giving you ba@@ d information , because they didn 't get it . They feel ba@@ d pa@@ using or repe@@ ating me , but they can do it all they want with a YouTube video , or they can go to W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , or they might be afraid of even ad@@ mi@@ tting that they don 't know how to bor@@ row or re@@ group or whatever , but now they can actually re@@ view it in these one off videos . Then other people started watching it , as well , and said , " Hey , there 's something there , " and on top of that , I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated with this , because that was the whole point in the first place , to have if you 've never seen this concept before , you at least have this out@@ let , these YouTube videos that you could some@@ how ac@@ cess , but before I go into the de@@ p@@ ths of this , I want to - On@@ ce this was built , then I had this , " This seems to be working , " but let 's comp@@ are it to what goes on right now in the school system . " If you think , the whole conversa@@ tion about education right now , it 's all about the stud@@ en@@ t- teacher ra@@ ti@@ os , how can we make the in@@ ner city , po@@ or schools look a lot like the fan@@ cy , ri@@ ch schools , give people com@@ pu@@ ters , but no one is fundamen@@ tally ques@@ tion@@ ing the model . If you really think about the model itself , I don 't want to tain@@ t your op@@ ini@@ on before - It 's biz@@ ar@@ re . You have this si@@ tu@@ ation , you go to the classroom and you 're all in a room together - We 'll talk about what you could do if you 're all in a room together , but there 's no interaction . It 's just this bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st lecture , espe@@ ci@@ ally once you get to the universi@@ ty level , but even in the classroom in mi@@ d@@ d@@ le school . There might be a little one question here or there , but fundamen@@ tally , it 's a bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st lecture to the room . The teacher is pretty much gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to lo@@ se half the students , or bor@@ e half the students , and at some point , they 're going to s@@ wit@@ ch the whole time . You do that , then the student has to go home , do their homework . They do it in a comple@@ te v@@ ac@@ u@@ um . They have a textbook , every other problem there 's a s@@ olution in the back , you don 't know why you got it right or wrong , anything . You don 't have an@@ yone to help you . If you 're lu@@ ck@@ y you might get a tu@@ tor or a par@@ ent might be able to help you . Then you go to the class the next day and there might be some type of re@@ view of homework or something , but really no real feedback and the cycle repe@@ at@@ s itself . You get another lecture , then you go back home , you do homework in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um , and this whole time you don 't know what you 're doing at all . The teacher has no data , nothing . That oc@@ cur@@ s for a couple of days and then , ba@@ m , you have an assessment . The assessment , some students get 50 % , 80 % , 70 % , 9@@ 0 % . The good students get 9@@ 5 % , next concept . E@@ ven if you fa@@ il an ex@@ am , the class mo@@ ves on . You don 't know half of the sub@@ ject , half of the materi@@ al in that pre@@ vious concept and the class is going to move on . You might say that fa@@ il@@ ing student 's ba@@ d and the A students are all right , but they still didn 't know 5 % of the concept . Maybe it was a car@@ el@@ ess mist@@ a@@ ke , but maybe they didn 't know what happens when you take something to the z@@ er@@ o@@ th power . Maybe they didn 't know exactly what a f@@ ra@@ c@@ tional ex@@ p@@ on@@ ent was , that one problem on the ex@@ am with the f@@ ra@@ c@@ tional ex@@ p@@ on@@ ent . That A student , the one who 's getting the posi@@ tive la@@ be@@ l , when they go to calculus and they see that , what are they going to do ? They 're not going to get 9@@ 5 % , they 're going to get 9@@ 0 % , because they 're going to mi@@ ss that and another concept . That 's not even to men@@ tion about the 50 % . You have this biz@@ ar@@ re - The first time you get assessment is when it 's time to move to the next concept . In no way is it ac@@ tion@@ able . If you really think about the process , it 's just this huge fil@@ ter@@ ing me@@ chan@@ is@@ m . It 's just this process where every ste@@ p of the way we 're just kno@@ cking more and more people off and the lu@@ ck@@ y people in this room , we were the people who happened to be lu@@ ck@@ y enough that we were ass@@ es@@ sed and fil@@ ter@@ ed at the right place at the right time and that led to us fe@@ eling really s@@ mar@@ t and going on . ( laughter ) That 's the way it works . It makes you really question - We 're all lu@@ ck@@ y . ( laughter ) That 's the big ta@@ ke@@ away . What 's happening here , what I think is happening here , is that whole cycle , it 's all happening in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ously with every interaction . The instru@@ ction , if you 've never seen multi@@ pl@@ ying deci@@ ma@@ ls before in your life , you cli@@ ck " watch video " , it pu@@ mp@@ s in from YouTube , and you can imagine there 's one or two videos right now , but you eventually have ten videos , you 're tra@@ cking whether the person wat@@ ched the video , you can eventually tra@@ ck whether they pa@@ used or repe@@ ated , where they wat@@ ched , and I 'll talk more about that later on , how you can per@@ fect the con@@ tent . They get the instru@@ ction there , then they can do the pra@@ cti@@ ce , so you 're giving them pra@@ cti@@ ce and you get im@@ medi@@ ate feedback . D@@ id I get it right or wrong ? If you don 't know how to do it , you get the exac@@ t ste@@ ps for that problem and then you 're also getting assessment , because every time you do a problem , it 's tra@@ cking everything about that . When you did it , how long it took you , how many times did you cli@@ ck " hin@@ t " , and then the para@@ di@@ g@@ m here , and I literally did this just on a whi@@ m , I was just like , " How do I know if someone really knows something ? " It 's not 9@@ 0 % , or it 's not 9@@ 5 % , just keep doing it until you get ten in a row . T@@ en in a row should be the para@@ di@@ g@@ m , because then that will en@@ for@@ ce a certain level of dis@@ ci@@ p@@ line . People say , " Oh isn 't that - No , when you take the S@@ A@@ T , you can 't make those little car@@ el@@ ess mist@@ ak@@ es . You should en@@ for@@ ce a certain level of pre@@ ci@@ sion . I just th@@ re@@ w out ten in a row . It doesn 't have to be ten in a row , it could be five in a row , or whatever , de@@ pen@@ ding on the concept , but if you think about what 's happening when you en@@ for@@ ce it is you don 't al@@ low that 9@@ 5 % student to move on while not kno@@ wing that 5 % and then only get lost in the next top@@ ic . That 's the general idea . This right here is the - This is just another example of a mo@@ du@@ le . This is slo@@ pe of a line . If you don 't know how to do , just do " hin@@ t " and it dra@@ ws things for you . It 's just another in@@ di@@ cation of - All of this is live . You can go right now to K@@ han@@ E@@ x@@ er@@ ci@@ ses . app@@ spo@@ t . co@@ m and you can try out all of this stuff and I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you if you have friends or family me@@ m@@ bers . There was even a guy at the he@@ dge fun@@ d I worked with who was going to take the G@@ M@@ A@@ T and he was sum@@ ma cu@@ m la@@ u@@ de from Y@@ al@@ e and he 's like , " What should I use for math ? " " You should use this . " He was like , " Hey , but this is starting me at 1@@ +@@ 1 . " I said , " Just do it . " T@@ w@@ o weeks later , he was like , " That was good . " ( laughter ) It 's a@@ maz@@ ing how long many people haven 't multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed deci@@ ma@@ ls . ( laughter ) That 's the sel@@ f- pac@@ ed student view of the world . I still haven 't given you the whole vir@@ tual school . R@@ ight now we 're talking about videos and then we 've kind of au@@ to@@ ma@@ ted the sel@@ f- dire@@ cted learning and learning at your own pace and getting ass@@ es@@ sed , but then you have to think about how can you in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate that with the human experience . You 're coming into a room together to es@@ sen@@ tially learn how can you use this technology to hy@@ per char@@ ge that ? Actually , before I even talk about this , there 's actually a very simple fli@@ pping of the classroom that I think should oc@@ c@@ ur tomorrow . You don 't need any of this software , because the videos already ex@@ i@@ st and some teachers - It wasn 't my idea - A teacher in London said that he is now - If you think , it 's actually a no@@ - bra@@ in@@ er . I don 't understand why this doesn 't happen worl@@ d@@ wide tomorrow . He is now as@@ sig@@ ning the lec@@ tures for homework and he 's having the students do homework in the classroom . There 's no other technology ne@@ cess@@ ary . Th@@ in@@ k about what happens there . R@@ ight now , we all ga@@ ther at seven in the mor@@ ning in 1@@ 0@@ 2@@ 50 and we 're all with our pe@@ ers and ( unintelligible ) We have to sit pas@@ si@@ vely and just get this bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st lecture and then we go off on our own and we do these problem se@@ ts in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um . If you fli@@ p the model and the lecture , as we said , is one siz@@ e f@@ its all , I might be lost or bor@@ ed , I might have ga@@ ps from the last lecture that I didn 't understand , but I still have to get this exac@@ t lecture . You fli@@ p the model , you get on- de@@ m@@ and video at home , when you 're ready for it , when you 're a@@ wa@@ ke . I got a le@@ tter from a student about they did actually have a good calculus teacher , but he had two ro@@ ws in front of him this really cu@@ te gir@@ l and every day he 's just trying to figu@@ re out how he can ask her out and he mi@@ ssed two months of calculus . ( laughter ) This was his only - ( laughter ) I say that 's a story of another person , but - ( laughter ) We all had si@@ mi@@ lar stor@@ i@@ es . ( laughter ) We go home and we do these problem se@@ ts in a comple@@ te v@@ ac@@ u@@ um . We have no one to help us , but if you fli@@ p it , you can watch things at your own pace , f@@ ill in your ga@@ ps , do whatever you need and then when you 're in the classroom , you have 30 or 40 or 4@@ 00 of your pe@@ ers to help you and you have the prof@@ ess@@ or who can wal@@ k around and in real time , see how people are doing , two weeks before the assessment , two weeks before everyone gets that la@@ be@@ l pla@@ ced on their head that they 're a B student . If you really think about it , hon@@ est@@ ly , and I 'm not this tou@@ ch@@ y - These people who are anti@@ - gra@@ des and that 's like , oh , that 's tou@@ ch@@ y fe@@ ely . I 'm anti@@ - gra@@ des because I think it 's ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . It 's not about - It 's because if you 're a B student , you sh@@ ouldn 't - Ever@@ yone should be for@@ ced to be an A student . It 's on that concept . It 's sil@@ ly , you 'll meet many , many people , and I think this room is an ex@@ ception , but you 'll meet many , many people who went through algebra , algebra two , ge@@ ome@@ try , pre@@ - calculus , tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try , calculus , and when they see an algebra problem in front of their face , they don 't see it . They have never had ma@@ stery of anything in between and this whole exerci@@ se of going from one ho@@ op to the next and being an A - student the whole way , it 's just an exerci@@ se in fil@@ ter@@ ing , it 's not an exerci@@ se in actually making people have tan@@ gi@@ ble skills that they can do something produ@@ c@@ tive with . What I just de@@ sc@@ rib@@ ed , fli@@ pping the model , that 's if you have no technology , but if you have the technology , what you can do is teach - There 's a bun@@ ch of student nam@@ es here that you can 't see , I 've b@@ lan@@ ked them out , but this is a repor@@ t that a teacher could have and this is actually a real repor@@ t , this isn 't a P@@ ho@@ to@@ sho@@ p ver@@ sion . This was at a sum@@ mer c@@ am@@ p where they used what I sho@@ wed you in the last couple sli@@ des as their math cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , where every student was able to work at their own pace and the teacher wal@@ ks in every day . E@@ ach col@@ um@@ n here is one of those modules that we saw on that first sli@@ de , one of those concep@@ ts . E@@ ach row here is a student . Gre@@ en means the student already got ten in a row on that concept . They did it , they 're co@@ ol . P@@ ur@@ ple means that they 're working on it right now , that that 's their fron@@ ti@@ er of learning at the moment . Ever@@ ything seems to be going o@@ kay . R@@ ed means that students done 50 problems . S@@ ome@@ times you can think of the he@@ u@@ ri@@ stic . That student 's done 50 problems , 9@@ 5 % of students who have done 50 problems in that mo@@ du@@ le usu@@ ally move on . This student has not . Some type of inter@@ ven@@ tion should oc@@ c@@ ur , some type of human inter@@ ven@@ tion . A teacher could look at this and ei@@ ther they could e@@ ye@@ b@@ all it . They could say , " Hey , look , everyone 's doing f@@ ine " but these two kids need help in level two divi@@ sion . " Let everyone else work at their own pace , " let me just take these two students a@@ side " and do a very in@@ ti@@ mate , focu@@ sed inter@@ ven@@ tion " on just those two students . " E@@ ven better , you can pa@@ ir these two students up with these two students ini@@ tially and see if that gets them over the hur@@ d@@ le . You can actually ca@@ p@@ ture the data before and after that . I 'm not there yet , but if the software is actually s@@ che@@ d@@ ul@@ ing the interac@@ tions , you can actually see what happens before those and start to ran@@ k teachers and students and all of that type of thing . S@@ lo@@ w@@ ly work up to the level of the teacher . What I think should happen and hope that this cat@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ es it is we go back to a one- room scho@@ ol@@ house . We go back to room ful@@ l of people , from K@@ in@@ der@@ gar@@ t@@ n@@ ers all the way to an@@ ybody . S@@ en@@ i@@ or ci@@ tiz@@ ens who want to come back and learn and they 're all working at their own pace and if you have trouble with a concept , even if you don 't know , this will know if you having trouble with a concept . It will pa@@ ir you with somebody else and it 'll know about that interaction , it 'll know how good of an instru@@ c@@ tor that person was before and after , you 'll r@@ ate them , whatever else . Then , you can keep es@@ ca@@ la@@ ting up and up the la@@ d@@ der until eventually you can get by the paid teacher . You can actually have a reali@@ ty where - O@@ b@@ viously there 's a huge as@@ pe@@ ct of actually teaching people for re@@ tention . This isn 't just a way to get e@@ con@@ o@@ mi@@ cs and scal@@ e . This whole me@@ chan@@ is@@ m , I 'm a n@@ in@@ th gra@@ der and I 'm teaching a si@@ x@@ th gra@@ der ne@@ ga@@ tive numbers . That , by itself , is a hu@@ g@@ ely powerful to@@ ol . I 'm learning things better than I ever learned before just doing these videos . You can imagine if you 're - And this whole level of ma@@ tu@@ ri@@ ty . I think , actually , if you han@@ g out with people ol@@ der and youn@@ ger than yourself , you actually ac@@ t more ma@@ ture for a whole set of reas@@ ons . Then , all of a sudden , you have a model , where everyone is learning , the classroom is actually an interac@@ tive experience , it 's no longer a pas@@ si@@ ve experience , everyone is op@@ er@@ ating exactly at the level that they need to , and it actually scal@@ es . You can actually make it e@@ con@@ o@@ mi@@ c . You could actually have - Ever@@ yone 's ob@@ ses@@ sed with stud@@ en@@ t- teacher ra@@ ti@@ os , but stud@@ en@@ t- teacher ra@@ ti@@ os assu@@ me a model that if there 's one of me and ten of you , then we can have a conversa@@ tion . If there 's one of me and 20 of you , we 're going to have less of a conversa@@ tion . If there 's one of me and 100 of you , we 're not going to have a conversa@@ tion . That 's true , to some de@@ gree , but here , everyone works at their own pace . E@@ ven if there 's 100 students and one paid tu@@ tor , because you have this interaction , I 'm wil@@ ling to be@@ t that you 're going to have a better interaction with that one paid teacher who can now be paid 100 g@@ r@@ and a year , instead of what teachers get paid . You 're going to have a better interaction in this world with a 100 : 1 stud@@ en@@ t- teacher ra@@ ti@@ o , than you 'd probably get in even the fan@@ ci@@ est pri@@ v@@ ate schools that there are right now . This right here , this is literally the sum@@ mer progra@@ m had asked about this and I was cu@@ ri@@ ous myself . This was literally me just doing se@@ qu@@ el qu@@ eri@@ es in the data every night from the sum@@ mer c@@ am@@ p . It 's not like a ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous study , but to me , it spe@@ aks to the power of every student working at their own pace and th@@ ro@@ ws into question , the traditional no@@ tions of assessment , which we , I think , sense are ( unintelligible ) to be@@ gin with . What this ch@@ art is doing , this ax@@ is right here is the days in the sum@@ mer c@@ am@@ p . It was a si@@ x@@ - week progra@@ m and this is just a coun@@ t of the modules comple@@ ted . This black line right here , that 's the class mean , the class a@@ ver@@ age . O@@ n day seven in this class of 30 or so students , the a@@ ver@@ age student has comple@@ ted 2@@ 3 modules . That 's what that tel@@ ls us . You can actually even see that they all started at 1@@ +@@ 1 . It was actually an interesting idea , because we started another group not at 1@@ +@@ 1 and some sub@@ set of the students always got stu@@ ck . They just never mo@@ ved on , even though we started them at fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de and they were se@@ ven@@ th gra@@ d@@ ers , some sub@@ set always got stu@@ ck . We saw when we started everyone at 1@@ +@@ 1 , no one got stu@@ ck , which tel@@ ls you that there are some s@@ mar@@ t people who have some ga@@ ps and it never gets ad@@ dre@@ ssed otherwise . You can have the best algebra teacher on the pla@@ net and you can have an in@@ n@@ at@@ ely very intellig@@ ent kid , but if he or she just is a little fo@@ g@@ gy on multi@@ pl@@ ying deci@@ ma@@ ls , there 's no hope , they 're just going to talk past each other and it 's just going to be a very f@@ ru@@ st@@ rat@@ ing experience . When we started everyone at 1@@ +@@ 1 , and you see it here . It 's a very ste@@ ep cur@@ ve , this is the re@@ view . This was the kids just getting ten in row , ten in row , ten in a row . Then it starts to level out a bit . This is , you can see the learning happening . The interesting thing , at least to me , the interesting thing about this is the green lin@@ es are st@@ and@@ ard de@@ vi@@ ation a@@ bo@@ ve and bel@@ ow that mean . You can p@@ lot all the students here , but this student in particu@@ lar , on day five , if you did a pre@@ - assessment for the class , if you did an assessment right here , he only comple@@ ted 12 modules . M@@ ore than one st@@ and@@ ard de@@ vi@@ ation bel@@ ow the mean . If you were in the traditional , if you were tra@@ cking students , you 'd say , " Oh , she 's a re@@ medi@@ al student , " she 's going to hold the class back , " or we have to hold the rest of the class back for her . " She doesn 't bel@@ ong in here , " all that and you would put a big la@@ be@@ l on her for@@ e@@ head . " You 're never going to be an engin@@ e@@ er , " and all of these things and actually it does happen around si@@ x@@ th or se@@ ven@@ th gra@@ de . That is when these lab@@ els , these car@@ e@@ ers get r@@ ul@@ ed out for students . Because she was able to spend a little - I was cu@@ ri@@ ous , I was like , " What happened to her ? " and I could go into the data and I could see exactly what she was doing . She was sp@@ en@@ ding more time than everyone else on ad@@ ding and sub@@ tra@@ cting ne@@ ga@@ tive numbers . Just to understand this ch@@ art right here , each ba@@ r , this is the first problem she did . R@@ ed is wrong , b@@ lu@@ e is right , and the he@@ ight is how long it took her . This is just from the data of the interaction . You can see she got a couple of questions wrong , then she maybe gu@@ es@@ sed one right , then you have this big long time she actually wat@@ ched the video here . I looked at the video lo@@ g . She wat@@ ched the video here , then she got a couple more right , but then she still got a few wrong . On@@ ce again , in a traditional classroom , she would have been said , " Oh , at this point you are an A student . " You got nine of ten right , or you got 19@@ / 20 right " and you 're an A student , " and for@@ ce her to keep going . A couple more right , one wrong , then fin@@ ally she got ten in a row . You can actually see that she also got fa@@ ster on it . There 's a whole other el@@ ement of spe@@ ed , which does matter on some st@@ andar@@ di@@ zed te@@ sts . On@@ ce she got through that , once she was able to just re@@ medi@@ ate her@@ self and really build a st@@ rong foun@@ da@@ tion , she just ra@@ ced a@@ head . This was just in six weeks . She went from being the second to wor@@ st student in the class , if you want to me@@ as@@ ure that way , to the second to thir@@ d best . All the students are on the ch@@ art here . In just six weeks . It makes you question , if you did an assessment here , and I show that because she literally ra@@ ced through level three lin@@ e@@ ar equ@@ ations , which is like 2@@ x@@ +@@ 7@@ =@@ - 3@@ x@@ - 4 and she just thought it was in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive after doing maybe level two . She just ra@@ ced . If you saw that student , you 'd say , " Oh , she 's gi@@ f@@ ted . " ( laughter ) It makes you really question . We were just the lu@@ ck@@ y kids that got ass@@ es@@ sed at the right time and got all posi@@ tive feedback and we were ass@@ es@@ sed at that point , but there 's probably a lot of people who might 've been able to e@@ at our l@@ un@@ ch eventually , who got ki@@ c@@ ked off . This , I show this , this is data from YouTube . I think everything I talked about before is how do you make sure a student lear@@ ns pro@@ per@@ ly and how do you make sure that their foun@@ da@@ tion is built and how do you use that data to op@@ ti@@ miz@@ e the ac@@ tual ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal interac@@ tions , but I show this to show that there 's another di@@ men@@ sion of per@@ fec@@ ting the ac@@ tual con@@ tent . This is data that YouTube gi@@ ves me . They call this a@@ udience at@@ tention . What they do is they me@@ as@@ ure the dro@@ p off r@@ ate off of a YouTube video rela@@ tive to the a@@ ver@@ age YouTube video of that len@@ g@@ th . Let 's say the a@@ ver@@ age YouTube video at minute three has lost 40 % of its a@@ udience . That 's just a natural dro@@ p off r@@ ate . At minute three , if I 've lost 40 % of my a@@ udience , I 'll be hu@@ g@@ g@@ ing the line right there . If I 've only lost 20 % of my a@@ udience , I 'll be a@@ bo@@ ve a@@ ver@@ age . That 's what they 're me@@ as@@ uring there , but you can imagine - Actually , I 've seen a few of my videos where this cur@@ ve does this . It just dro@@ ps off . I can go at that exac@@ t minute in the video and see , Oh , I said or@@ th@@ o@@ gon@@ ality and I never de@@ fin@@ ed or@@ th@@ o@@ gon@@ ality . I can ei@@ ther re- recor@@ d the video , I could put a little bu@@ b@@ ble there , where you can get more information . You 're getting real data that allo@@ ws you to actually it@@ er@@ ate and per@@ fect on what you 're produ@@ cing and you can imagine two di@@ men@@ sions , this is at@@ tention . You could also have ef@@ fi@@ c@@ ac@@ y , if you couple it with the ac@@ tual exerci@@ se and you keep it@@ er@@ ating on it until you have a ge@@ m of a video and you can even have multi@@ ple people 's videos and see what 's better for different people . This all exist@@ s in N@@ et@@ fli@@ x . There 's no reason why it sh@@ ouldn 't ex@@ i@@ st in education . This right here is the big picture . I 'm talking about a vir@@ tual school for the world . This is what I think it 's going to be and I 'm open to any ideas or any nu@@ an@@ ce parts of it , but you have your video library . That 's the lo@@ w@@ - h@@ ang@@ ing f@@ ru@@ it , it 's the first line of instru@@ ction , you can pa@@ use it and repe@@ at it . One thing , I spoke to a j@@ our@@ nal of high@@ er education recently and sometimes I 'm very di@@ plo@@ mati@@ c , I don 't ro@@ ck too many bo@@ at@@ s , but I was in a qu@@ ir@@ k@@ y mo@@ od and I ha@@ dn 't eat@@ en for a long time . ( laughter ) People who know my e@@ ating ha@@ bi@@ ts , I often don 't e@@ at for long peri@@ ods of time , but I just went off . I was like , " I challen@@ ge you , " because this is a j@@ our@@ nal read by profes@@ sor@@ s and edu@@ cat@@ ors . I was like , " Why does a 300 person lecture even ex@@ i@@ st any@@ more ? " In what way , just tell me one way that that is better than on- de@@ m@@ and video . I 'm happy for any of you all to - It 's this bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st lecture to a room of people in a certain am@@ oun@@ t of time that 's 9@@ 0 minutes long , people have ga@@ ps , and the prof@@ ess@@ or se@@ es b@@ lan@@ k fac@@ es . It 's just this all around - I think the only reason it exist@@ s is because people as@@ so@@ ci@@ ate it with the colle@@ ge experience . People expect when I pay 30 or $@@ 4@@ 0@@ , 000 , I should get this . That 's the only , in my mind , why it exist@@ s . With on- de@@ m@@ and video you can pa@@ use , repe@@ at it . The produ@@ cer can get data on what 's working , what 's not . You can get your best profes@@ sor@@ s to produce the best con@@ tent and keep it@@ er@@ ating it , making it better and better . People can f@@ ill in their ga@@ ps . That 's what the video library 's all about . Then you have the we@@ b appli@@ ca@@ tions . You saw one of them , but there 's actually another one . There 's some gen@@ t@@ le@@ men in the back of the room who started working on it . There 's a whole su@@ ite of we@@ b appli@@ ca@@ tions you can build for allo@@ wing people to learn at their own pace . What you saw was for math . We 're working on something . I 'd be happy to talk about it if you 're all cu@@ ri@@ ous for more fac@@ t- based know@@ le@@ dge . Le@@ ar@@ ning am@@ eri@@ can history or ge@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , things like that . You can even have we@@ b appli@@ ca@@ tions for pe@@ er assessment , for creative writing , all sor@@ ts of things . When you actually com@@ pose things for other people to re@@ view , it be@@ comes a whole other level , whole other g@@ ame than when you 're writing something for a teacher to mar@@ k up and say you 're a B@@ + and then th@@ row it away . There 's a whole su@@ ite of we@@ b appli@@ ca@@ tions you can build and then on top of that you use all of that data to actually fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ate pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er interac@@ tions . I hin@@ ted that in the classroom , but there 's no reason why it just has to be li@@ mi@@ ted to the classroom . If I 'm having trouble with qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m me@@ ch@@ ani@@ cs and the best instru@@ c@@ tor for qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m me@@ ch@@ ani@@ cs is in M@@ ex@@ i@@ c@@ o C@@ ity and we 're both free at 4 : 00 P@@ M ea@@ ster@@ n time , no reason that we can 't set up an interaction with a p@@ en ta@@ b@@ let , the way I used to do it with my cou@@ sin Na@@ dia and have an interaction , even better recor@@ d that interaction , so that other people in the future can use it . I r@@ ate them based on how they were , they can even r@@ ate me on how I was as a student and the system knows what I did before and after that interaction . It actually knows whether it was a statisti@@ cally sig@@ nifi@@ c@@ ant inter@@ ven@@ tion in some way . This is the big picture and you can just keep getting the data and it@@ er@@ ating and it@@ er@@ ating and it@@ er@@ ating it to make it a better s@@ olution . That 's the ma@@ ster p@@ lan . ( laughter ) An@@ y questions ? Yeah . I know you 've got this ini@@ ti@@ al focus of K through 12 and math and wha@@ t@@ not . Audience Member : Audience Member : S@@ or@@ ry , we can 't hear the question . Audience Member : Okay , one of the things you said really stru@@ ck me as an edu@@ cat@@ or , which is your com@@ ment about everyone should be for@@ ced to be an A student . If you think about this is a ( unintelligible ) exerci@@ se with a lot of un@@ wil@@ ling in@@ stitu@@ tions trying to get them to change . It seems to me that this idea , just this one idea would be very powerful to take into profes@@ sion@@ al cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation , say n@@ ur@@ sing de@@ gre@@ es , where you 're not going to be a n@@ ur@@ se until you a@@ chi@@ eve this level of compe@@ ten@@ cy on the ex@@ am . Ta@@ ke a profes@@ sion , where this idea that everybody does have to be an A student in order to have a car@@ e@@ er and get them to bu@@ y into this model and maybe get the resources from that sort of problem or that sort of fi@@ el@@ d to te@@ st these ideas out and to show how they work or they find im@@ ple@@ men@@ tation or whatever . Sal : I think it exist@@ s in profes@@ sion@@ al development , because people say , " Lo@@ ok , if you 're a n@@ ur@@ se " and you don 't know this , people are going to die , " so they do en@@ for@@ ce that with doc@@ tors , n@@ ur@@ ses , and - That exist@@ s , but it isn 't - We could do st@@ udi@@ es , but I think it 's almost in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive that if you go back to - S@@ ome@@ one that has real ma@@ stery of algebra is going to be way more powerful than someone who has B - student level of underst@@ anding of algebra through differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ations . They 're never going to be able to app@@ ly any of it , as op@@ posed to - I 've worked at - When I was working at a he@@ dge fun@@ d , there was once a C@@ F@@ O who said - I was like , " What 's your incre@@ men@@ tal g@@ ross mar@@ gin ? " He 's like , " Oh , we don 't div@@ ul@@ ge that . " I was like , " You just ga@@ ve it to me . " You told me your g@@ ross prof@@ it in two peri@@ ods " and how many un@@ its you s@@ old in two peri@@ ods ( laughter ) " That 's your - Ever@@ yone in the room was like , " Oh my God , " this is some kind of ro@@ cke@@ t science , " ( laughter ) That is algebra one , that is algebra one , and no one in the room . There are M@@ B@@ As , there were P@@ h@@ D@@ s in the room , very s@@ mar@@ t people , but no one could recogni@@ ze and that is a fa@@ il@@ ure and these are the success@@ ful people in our education system . People need to - If we had real ma@@ stery of algebra , the world would be a different place . All the calculus and all of that other stuff would just be for fun , but it 's not - I don 't even think it has to be te@@ st@@ ed . If people really underst@@ o@@ od algebra , that 's going to be way better than people hal@@ f@@ way underst@@ anding algebra and then mo@@ ving on to other things . Yeah ? Audience Member : A question about the pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er interaction . Do you see that happening now , actually ? If you have 16 million views on YouTube , I imagine there 's com@@ ments . I@@ s there com@@ ment mo@@ der@@ ation happening ? Sal : You all can go home and look . Some of the debat@@ es or even some of the com@@ men@@ tar@@ y on the YouTube videos are like what teachers would dre@@ am of having in their classroom . S@@ ome@@ one says , " Hey , this was a great video , " but I don 't quite get what Sal did at minute 2 : 3@@ 4 , " and there 's a little lin@@ k in YouTube you can go right back to that little point in the video . Then other people will com@@ ment on it and say , " Oh , you just have to watch that other video " and he ex@@ pla@@ ins that in de@@ p@@ th , " or , " Here 's another page you can watch , " or they 'll actually just ex@@ pla@@ in it right there . This is just on a simple mes@@ sa@@ ge bo@@ ard . It de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely already exist@@ s and it 's literally just - I get at least five ema@@ il@@ s a day as@@ king for a better com@@ mun@@ ity to ta@@ p into this and I 've just been wa@@ iting to do it right . It 's there and people love to help each other and they just don 't have a good way of doing it right now . Audience Member : I have children in the first gra@@ de and f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de . What would you su@@ g@@ ge@@ st I do with them with this ? Sal : F@@ ir@@ st through f@@ our@@ th ? Audience Member : F@@ ir@@ st and f@@ our@@ th . Sal : This is not sci@@ enti@@ fic . I 've tried out the ap@@ p with different ag@@ ed kids . The 1@@ +@@ 1 , it is 1@@ +@@ 1 but it doesn 't have dan@@ cing be@@ ars . ( laughter ) I hope to eventually have dan@@ cing - Ever@@ yone lik@@ es dan@@ cing ( laughter ) A K@@ in@@ der@@ gar@@ t@@ ner . I found K@@ in@@ der@@ gar@@ ten - I 've seen some pre@@ co@@ ci@@ ous second or thir@@ d gra@@ d@@ ers get into it . They don 't need the dan@@ cing be@@ ars and the music and all of that type of thing . Your f@@ our@@ th gra@@ der , I think , could be ready for this . The videos I 've seen very young kids like them . They like the - I don 't know what they like about it . They like the black back@@ grou@@ nd and the col@@ ors . They respon@@ d to the videos . I 've seen three or four year ol@@ ds , it hol@@ ds their at@@ tention . I don 't know if they 're re@@ ta@@ ining anything . ( laughter ) You might want to start with the videos for your youn@@ ger student , but the f@@ our@@ th gra@@ der , I think , is ready for the ap@@ p . Audience Member : The youn@@ ger kid goes stra@@ ight to the YouTube . Sal : Yeah , I think so , and you might want to watch it with them . Some people have told me that they watch a couple of videos at night with their kid and it 's in place of a be@@ d@@ time story . ( laughter ) Why not ? Audience Member : Are your videos in your system a little too big for one laptop per child ? The question is your video and your system a little too big for one laptop per child ? Audience Member : What 's the question ? Sal : I gu@@ ess there 's a couple of - In terms of ... Audience Member : Ge@@ tting any of that con@@ tent to them , because right now I think they 're just doing textbook for@@ mat , right ? Yeah , so the question is , is it too big for getting the con@@ tent into one laptop per child ? Sal : The e@@ asy answer is no . When I first saw one laptop per child , this is before Khan Academy was really well thought out , I was like , " What are they going to do on that one laptop per child ? " There 's exam@@ ples of people using it for li@@ ghts and things as op@@ posed to for a computer . I think it could be used tomorrow on one laptop per child . Audience Member : But do they have enough dri@@ ve sp@@ ac@@ e and things like that ? A lot of them don 't have ne@@ t@@ work conne@@ cti@@ vity . The ra@@ w videos , they 're going to be on i@@ T@@ un@@ es U soon , so I just talked to the App@@ le people and I h@@ and@@ ed them the dis@@ k that had all the ra@@ w videos and it was 40 gi@@ gs . Sal : I think if you took the F@@ lash versi@@ ons , it 's 14 gi@@ gs . I don 't know how big the hard dri@@ ves are , though , but soon they 're going to be able to st@@ ore all of the - Audience Member : It 's actually something you should look into , because that 's a big de@@ al , right ? Sal : I would love to . If they called me up , I 'd say , " Yeah . " ( laughter ) I 'd love to , I 'd love to . We can have another talk about - I 'm talking to a couple of foun@@ da@@ tions . One laptop per child would be aw@@ es@@ ome if there 's the resources , but you don 't ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily need one laptop per child . G@@ et some $@@ 2@@ 00 re@@ fur@@ bi@@ sh@@ ed P@@ C , put it in the vil@@ la@@ ge . Now , all of a sudden , you can have as@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ ron@@ ous learning , which is what these vil@@ la@@ ge kids need , because they have to take off for the har@@ v@@ est , they have a whole spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m . Some of them can 't read , some of them have pretty reas@@ on@@ able pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ ency . That $@@ 2@@ 00 re@@ fur@@ bi@@ sh@@ ed P@@ C , instead of being one per student , you have 20 students per day working on it , each half an hour a day , doing this type of thing , and then as a foun@@ da@@ tion , for the first time in the history of p@@ hi@@ lan@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c giving , you actually have real data on what 's happening in real time on the ac@@ tual u@@ ti@@ liz@@ ation on your as@@ se@@ ts , where students are , how they 're perfor@@ ming and in terms of the ac@@ tual cost , it 's a $@@ 2@@ 00 P@@ C that 'll last four years , so it 's $@@ 50 a year and you 're edu@@ c@@ ating 20 students . That 's $@@ 2 . 50 per student per year for an education , which is compe@@ ti@@ tive with any@@ where in the thir@@ d world . It 's che@@ ap@@ er than pen@@ ci@@ l and pa@@ per . I think that 's what should be the model , but if they get a laptop that 's even better . Oh , in the back , yeah . I think you said you do all the video and lec@@ tures yourself . Audience Member : How long does it take you to put together a mo@@ du@@ le ? There 's some top@@ ic areas su@@ re@@ ly you don 't know all of it . ( laughter ) Sal : A video , if it 's a work - There 's probably people ema@@ il@@ ing me right now some algebra . I think I may really be doing some kid 's homework for them . Th@@ ose type of things where it 's just an algebra problem , someone ema@@ il@@ s it to me , I haven 't done that exac@@ t problem before , let me just do it , that 's the ten minutes on the video , pl@@ us five minutes to up@@ lo@@ ad , it 's a very small am@@ oun@@ t of time . If you saw that first s@@ cre@@ en , I 've started doing world history videos . Th@@ ose take a lot of - Audience Member : What do you mean by a lot ? Sal : When I started on the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution , I sp@@ ent a week doing nothing but re@@ ad@@ ing on the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution . I literally just took time off and I ste@@ e@@ ped myself in the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution . I think we 've all found this when we were going to school is that when you 're in the mi@@ d@@ st of a class , you really are an exper@@ t for that short period of time until the ex@@ am you are an exper@@ t , but then it all goes away . ( laughter ) For that short period of time , you can talk to any aca@@ demic any@@ where in the world and you know all of the deta@@ il@@ s and the nu@@ an@@ ces and everything . A@@ b@@ out a week of stud@@ ying and it 's fun stud@@ ying . It 's not for an ex@@ am , it 's for me and I get to make YouTube videos . I 'll do that and then I 'll start making the videos and then I can probably produce two or three videos a day . On@@ ce I have the big picture and I understand the maj@@ or pi@@ ec@@ es and I have a sense of - If you watch those videos , I c@@ ut and pa@@ st@@ e a bun@@ ch of i@@ mag@@ es and ma@@ ps from W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia and I just ex@@ pla@@ in them . I 'm a big ma@@ p person , so I do that . In the back ? Audience Member : I@@ s the software that you use to do things like dra@@ w per@@ fec@@ tly stra@@ ight lin@@ es or doing a ra@@ ti@@ o something you can bu@@ y off the sh@@ el@@ f ( unintelligible ) or did you design that all yourself ? No , some people have of@@ fer@@ ed to pay for it , but I didn 't build any software . Sal : Actually , all I use is I started off using Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft P@@ a@@ in@@ t . I made the back@@ grou@@ nd black and I used this thing called S@@ cre@@ en V@@ ide@@ o R@@ ec@@ order , too , which is this shar@@ e@@ w@@ are , fre@@ e@@ w@@ are , or $@@ 20 s@@ cre@@ en ca@@ p@@ ture software . That 's what I started the first 500 videos were done like that . Then someone just s@@ ent me a C@@ am@@ ta@@ si@@ a li@@ cen@@ se . They 're like , " This is great , we need to ( unintelligible ) . " You need a better s@@ cre@@ en ca@@ p@@ ture . " So I started using C@@ am@@ ta@@ si@@ a and then I used S@@ mo@@ o@@ th D@@ ra@@ w , too , which is pressure sen@@ si@@ tive , so it actually looks like I 'm writing with a p@@ en , as op@@ posed to Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft P@@ a@@ in@@ t , but you could get set up for $@@ 2@@ 00 at home with exactly what I have . It 's all found stuff . There 's probably better stuff out there . What I 'm using right now , I can 't dra@@ w a stra@@ ight line . With Mi@@ cro@@ so@@ ft P@@ a@@ in@@ t I could , because it had the line to@@ ol . In line with your idea of this as en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , so re@@ pla@@ cing be@@ d@@ time stor@@ i@@ es , I think there 's a ni@@ ch@@ e for re@@ ti@@ re@@ es . Audience Member : I know any number of people who , first thing in the mor@@ ning , do three cro@@ ss@@ words and a su@@ do@@ k@@ u . Sal : E@@ x@@ ac@@ tly . Audience Member : ( unintelligible ) Sal : ( unintelligible ) My mother in la@@ w ( unintelligible ) ( laughter ) I have go@@ tten le@@ t@@ ters from re@@ ti@@ re@@ es saying that they started doing it instead of su@@ do@@ k@@ u and other than ke@@ e@@ ping them shar@@ p , they 're not conne@@ cting with their g@@ rand@@ kids . They 're be@@ coming the g@@ rand@@ kids ' tu@@ tor and this is a whole level of conne@@ ction that they couldn 't have before , so there is something . Not the re@@ ti@@ re@@ es , there 's a lot of h@@ om@@ es@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing parents - I think there 's a lot of h@@ om@@ es@@ cho@@ ol@@ ers who are doing great until about algebra and then they 're like , " What do I do next ? " This is hel@@ ping them out . There 's a lot of people who sur@@ pri@@ se me . There 's a lot of mi@@ li@@ tar@@ y people who are actually my age who are going back to colle@@ ge . If you think about it , if you 're in your mi@@ d- 30@@ s and you want to go back to colle@@ ge , and the first thing you 're going to see when you go to colle@@ ge is colle@@ ge algebra and ( unintelligible ) There is nothing out there for you . You 're hel@@ p@@ less and this is the only thing that 's out there and they 're e@@ ter@@ n@@ ally th@@ an@@ k@@ ful that they could re- learn ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic and algebra and all these things that they haven 't seen for 20 years . It 's sur@@ pri@@ sing . I have an ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ der and my question is , would you say that the videos sometimes could re@@ place going back to the textbook when they get stu@@ ck , or - Audience Member : Sal : Yeah , so the question and this - Audience Member : Because the text@@ books - Sal : Oh , don 't get me started about text@@ books . ( laughter ) No , I will get started about text@@ books . The question was , " I have an ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ der . " Do you think the videos can re@@ place the textbook ? " Let 's think about what a textbook is . There 's two things in a textbook . There 's something that cla@@ im@@ s to be some form of ex@@ plan@@ ation , two pa@@ ges of text on something , and then it 's exerci@@ ses . There 's 50 problems ( unintelligible ) . I gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e you on- de@@ m@@ and video , whether it 's Khan Academy or an@@ ybody , is going to be better than that pro@@ se or whatever you want to call it , that 's trying to ex@@ pla@@ in the concept and it 's usu@@ ally ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed more for pe@@ er@@ - re@@ view , more for the other textbook au@@ th@@ ors saying , " Oh y@@ es , he did it ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously , that 's ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent , " as op@@ posed for the ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ der who wan@@ ts - Audience Member : ( unintelligible ) Sal : E@@ x@@ ac@@ tly , I think there 's a small sub@@ set of people who could actually read a textbook and that 's what a lot of us would probably get where we got , because we could actually con@@ su@@ me that information , but most people - On@@ - de@@ m@@ and video is better than that and from an exerci@@ se point of view , the textbook company doesn 't know who 's doing what exerci@@ se when , who 's watching what , what 's actually being effec@@ tive . They 're not getting re@@ al@@ - time data . That stuff I sho@@ wed - You can ar@@ gu@@ e what the modules should look like , but something like that is going to be in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely better , espe@@ ci@@ ally if you can tw@@ e@@ ak it and get data on what 's working , what are people using . For all we know , textbook publish@@ ers , half of those problems are never touched by an@@ ybody . They 're in there and kids are getting her@@ ni@@ as car@@ r@@ ying those problems around and it 's a - The answer 's y@@ es , I think that text@@ books need to go , on a lot of le@@ vel@@ s . Audience Member : So for world history , what kind of problems do you put out there so you can make your assessment ? The question is for world history what kind of problems can you put out there ? Sal : What I sho@@ wed you , those modules , that 's good for something that can be temp@@ la@@ tiz@@ ed , that you can ma@@ p . You can even do some ph@@ y@@ si@@ cs problems like that , the c@@ ore problems . You could do some ty@@ pes of che@@ mist@@ ry , maybe gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cs , but what about the ca@@ uses of the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar . Audience Member : Not just that , but an@@ al@@ y@@ sis of comple@@ x issues . Sal : Yeah , there 's two le@@ vel@@ s of things like history . One is the , " What did M@@ il@@ lar@@ d F@@ il@@ l@@ more do ? " There 's that level and then there 's the level of , " Let 's talk about the im@@ pac@@ ts of sla@@ very today , " or something . The c@@ ore stuff , and that 's what I 'm working on with those two gen@@ t@@ le@@ men in the back there . L@@ it@@ er@@ ally I met them , ( unintelligible ) we met last week , but what we 're working on is a - We 're working on - If we were stud@@ ying for a fac@@ tual based thing , we would get together in a big study group and write f@@ lash car@@ ds for each other and then qu@@ iz each other on each other 's questions . What we 're working on is a world - For American H@@ ist@@ or@@ y , put the whole cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um there and then if you say , " I 'm going to write a question " on the An@@ te@@ bel@@ lu@@ m P@@ eri@@ od . " C@@ li@@ ck An@@ te@@ bel@@ lu@@ m , you write a question , you can em@@ b@@ ed a video , i@@ ma@@ ge , whatever you want . On@@ ce you feel good about it , you put the cor@@ re@@ ct cho@@ ice , in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct cho@@ i@@ ces , ex@@ plan@@ ation . On@@ ce you feel good about it , you pub@@ lish it . If I 'm the first person to see your question , I 'll say , " Hey , war@@ ning , this is an un@@ touched question , " and all of that stuff , but you should try it out . I do the question , I r@@ ate it on qu@@ ality , dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ty , and im@@ portan@@ ce and then you start building this library of questions with me@@ ta@@ data around it and you can imagine that you 're col@@ lec@@ ting data , people who knew this question didn 't know that question , so you can qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ ti@@ vely say what 's e@@ asy or what 's har@@ der . There 's all sor@@ ts of ways you can con@@ su@@ me the question . You could imagine a teacher , because you 're getting all of this data . You know exactly how long it takes for a certain type of student to comple@@ te a question , whether they get it right or wrong . You can imagine a history teacher , once you get this huge data , this huge library questions , like you know what , I want to ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er an ex@@ am to my history students tomorrow , I 'm going to bring them to the computer lab . I want 50 questions and I don 't want more than a 9@@ 5 % chan@@ ce that more than two people ar@@ en 't going to fin@@ ish that ex@@ am and we 'll have all of the data , because it 'll know for that level of student how long it 'll take them , it 'll do the statisti@@ cal model and then , ba@@ m , ( unintelligible ) . That 's for the c@@ ore and you can do that for anything . ( unintelligible ) The more nu@@ an@@ ced stuff , that 's an open question . I 'm open to ideas . I think there 's things , a pe@@ er re@@ view of es@@ says , or you could ar@@ gu@@ e through es@@ says and have people vo@@ te on who 's ar@@ gu@@ ment is better . There 's all sor@@ ts of things you can do . That ha@@ s@@ n 't been - F@@ or@@ ei@@ gn language , I was thinking , I have a 15 month old . S@@ k@@ y@@ pe exist@@ s , the best for@@ ei@@ gn language , I 'm going to have him c@@ hat for a half an hour a week with somebody in M@@ ex@@ i@@ c@@ o C@@ ity , D@@ u@@ ba@@ i , H@@ ong K@@ ong . H@@ al@@ f an hour a week and he 'll just c@@ hat . That 's for@@ ei@@ gn language . I think there 's some very simple things with found technology right now that that could sol@@ ve some of these problems . The im@@ mer@@ sion , as op@@ posed to ( unintelligible ) . Oh , yeah ? Audience Member : V@@ er@@ y cu@@ ri@@ ous to hear your thou@@ ghts about the T@@ ex@@ as Bo@@ ard of E@@ du@@ cation and - Sal : What about education ? Audience Member : Ha@@ ve you heard about the T@@ ex@@ as Bo@@ ard of E@@ du@@ cation ? Sal : Oh , the T@@ ex@@ as Bo@@ ard of E@@ du@@ cation ( cro@@ s@@ st@@ al@@ k ) Audience Members : They 're trying to re@@ write the text@@ books , espe@@ ci@@ ally around American history . I 'm wonder@@ ing if that made you re@@ think about your missi@@ on with Khan Academy or - Sal : Oh yeah , that 's interesting . He 's as@@ king about the T@@ ex@@ as Bo@@ ard of E@@ du@@ cation , the re@@ writing of American H@@ ist@@ or@@ y and all that . F@@ ro@@ m a personal level , that 's the power of this thing . I could all of a sudden - I do every now and then go on Go@@ o@@ g@@ le blo@@ g search and I see who 's using these Khan Academy videos . O@@ b@@ viously , it 's a lot of h@@ om@@ es@@ cho@@ ol@@ ers and all that , but actually , a Wh@@ ite S@@ u@@ pre@@ ma@@ cy group lo@@ ves the Khan Academy . ( laughter ) Because they 're like , " This is qu@@ ality instru@@ ction , " our kids ar@@ en 't getting it , this is the only way " that they 're going to be able to compe@@ te with the A@@ si@@ ans " and the J@@ e@@ ws and the - ( laughter ) They could 've go@@ tten me to teach them , or they would 've let me get into their house and teach their kid , but because they recogni@@ ze that this is better than what they 're getting in the school , I 'm able to get into those kids ' he@@ a@@ ds , ( laughter ) which would never ( unintelligible ) ( laughter ) I think that whole T@@ ex@@ as thing , I think it 's a n@@ on- issu@@ e . I think with the inter@@ net and all that , they can de@@ b@@ ate night and day over what should be in the textbook , no one 's going to care at the end of the day , because they 're going to get information from other s@@ ources . The reali@@ ty is most of the kids ar@@ en 't learning what they 're trying to put in the text@@ books , so who car@@ es ? ( laughter ) Audience Member : Are you able to - D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent people learn in different ways . For example , some people might learn with exam@@ ples and other people want to learn more de@@ du@@ cti@@ vely . Can you i@@ d@@ enti@@ f@@ y the ways that people learn and then ad@@ just the instru@@ ction to mat@@ ch the spe@@ cial need ? Yeah , the question was can you ad@@ just to de@@ du@@ c@@ tive lear@@ n@@ ers ver@@ su@@ s people who need exam@@ ples ? Sal : We could . I don 't do it yet , I don 't cla@@ im that it 's already done and all that , but it de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely could be done and that 's another value of this . Some people say , " Oh , are you teaching it this new way or re@@ grou@@ ping " or are you teaching the old way with bor@@ ro@@ wing " or are you teaching the ab@@ stra@@ ct man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tive way " or are you teaching ... Let 's do both , let 's do both , and people can pi@@ ck and cho@@ ose what they want or do both . In a traditional classroom , you have to make these deci@@ sions because you have a sc@@ ar@@ ce am@@ oun@@ t of time , sc@@ ar@@ ce am@@ oun@@ t of resources , you have to teach it this way or that way , but here you can teach them both ways . T@@ each it the de@@ du@@ c@@ tive way and then do a lot of exam@@ ples , because that 's the way most people en@@ joy it . There 's nothing to stop you from doing it . Audience Member : I saw the gra@@ p@@ h e@@ arli@@ er , where you show how you get from ( unintelligible ) all the way through and that 's how the ( unintelligible ) works to build a foun@@ da@@ tion and you can ex@@ t@@ end that even fur@@ ther by anything that 's fac@@ tual , history or ge@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , by taking the gra@@ p@@ h ( unintelligible ) . You can imagine , after you just learned about the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution , and a le@@ s@@ son about F@@ ren@@ ch ge@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , you could then be of@@ fer@@ ed to take a look at ( unintelligible ) for example and since you 've learned about ( unintelligible ) you can learn about ( unintelligible ) can get you to ( unintelligible ) you can always rela@@ te it to something you already know . E@@ speci@@ ally once you have a question library and you think about the best way to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate it . Sal : R@@ ight now it 's just a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . You can say , " I want to learn about the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution , " but ( unintelligible ) organi@@ cally , what you 're su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ing . I haven 't built it , but it can be built today , and it 's kind of sil@@ ly that it 's not being built , espe@@ ci@@ ally consi@@ der@@ ing how le@@ ver@@ a@@ ge@@ - able something like that is . Ha@@ ve you thought about teaching parents , edu@@ cat@@ ors , teachers on how to teach , how to com@@ muni@@ c@@ ate effec@@ ti@@ vely to your a@@ udience , how to trou@@ b@@ le@@ sho@@ ot where the han@@ gu@@ ps , the ga@@ ps are . Audience Member : The questions is have I ever thought about teaching to edu@@ cat@@ ors or parents how to - Sal : There 's an interesting story there , too . This was when Khan Academy was like , I was happy if an@@ yone called me ( unintelligible ) Th@@ ree years ago , Mi@@ am@@ i D@@ a@@ de con@@ ta@@ cted me and said , " Can we use your videos for teacher tra@@ ining ? " I was like , " Yeah , sure , that 's aw@@ es@@ ome . " You all are real edu@@ cat@@ ors and you all want to use my videos . I was like , " but why don 't you let the students use them , too . " ( laughter ) There is a reali@@ ty now where ... I think there would be value in tel@@ ling teachers , " Lo@@ ok , you don 't have to be per@@ fect , just be human , " and just be conversa@@ tional , and don 't talk down , " and don 't try to use this as a power exer@@ tion type " of classroom man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment type of thing , use it - I don 't bla@@ me teachers , because the system for@@ ces them to man@@ age a classroom , de@@ m@@ and re@@ spe@@ ct , if they have a gap in their know@@ le@@ dge , you can 't be hon@@ est . If you do that in a classroom then they 're going to under@@ mine you . There 's all these other d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs that oc@@ c@@ ur why a teacher can 't be human . We 're in a world where we 'll probably get a sub@@ set of teachers who are scal@@ ing up and then the rest of the teachers le@@ ver@@ age this to become the human one- on- one men@@ tor and I think that 'll be the value . It 'll just be kind of example if they say , " Hey , let 's watch this together , " and then , " D@@ id you get it ? " If you don 't then I 'll be your men@@ tor to wal@@ k you through it . " I 'd be happy to if an@@ yone was interest@@ ed in me doing ( unintelligible ) anything like that , but yeah . Audience Member : I 'm cu@@ ri@@ ous about the pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er interac@@ tions and com@@ mun@@ ity and how you 've got and where you could be going . You 've touched on a couple of things I think are just worl@@ d- changing . Inter@@ gener@@ ati@@ on@@ al , know@@ le@@ dge trans@@ f@@ er , w@@ is@@ dom , you talked about one room scho@@ ol@@ ro@@ om@@ s , but what about just the usu@@ al par@@ en@@ t- child . There 's so much that could happen using this model . W@@ here are you ? Yeah , so the pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er , that 's at the most on the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard right now . Sal : I haven 't ... I 've tried it out with my cousins as a one off b@@ as@@ is . I feel like it 'll de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely work and the data is being set off , but kno@@ ck on whatever this is made out of . ( laughter ) H@@ op@@ ef@@ ully in the next few weeks we 'll get some resources to start doing - That 's the most tech@@ ni@@ cally in@@ ten@@ si@@ ve and we want to get to the point where not only are we doing pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er and it 's se@@ am@@ less and it 's ca@@ p@@ tur@@ ing data , but it 's also recor@@ ding those interac@@ tions . You need some - On@@ ce you recor@@ d , then it 's ( unintelligible ) . I a@@ gree with the whole teacher , with the - I want a world where you can - If your parents want to take you to E@@ uro@@ pe , it 's not going to compe@@ te with your school . You go on that tri@@ p to E@@ uro@@ pe and maybe there 's another one room scho@@ ol@@ house part of the same ne@@ t@@ work that you can go to and meet the kids in Par@@ is while you 're there . O@@ n the plan@@ e you can do - ( unintelligible ) I a@@ gree with you completely . The pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er is the har@@ de@@ st to do and it 's going to be the one that maybe happens , but I think it 'll happen in the next five years . I think the po@@ tenti@@ al is large . What 's the op@@ ti@@ mal len@@ g@@ th or ran@@ ge for the different modules and how many times do you have to re@@ ta@@ pe it to sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ y yourself that it 's good enough ? Audience Member : The question is , what 's the op@@ ti@@ mal len@@ g@@ th for I 'm assu@@ ming the videos espe@@ ci@@ ally and how many times do I have to re@@ ta@@ pe it ? Sal : When I started off , YouTube li@@ mi@@ ts you to 10 minutes . Now they let me do longer videos , I 'm a par@@ t@@ ner and all of that , but when you start off it 's 10 minutes , so my first video was 1@@ 1 minutes and they didn 't let me up@@ lo@@ ad it . ( laughter ) I paid at@@ tention to the clo@@ ck and I made my videos around nine or ten minutes . That 's the single big@@ ge@@ st point of feedback that that is the ide@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of time to get one concept across while being able to pay at@@ tention . I 've go@@ tten le@@ t@@ ters from people . I 've talked to some people at Go@@ o@@ g@@ le who have done some us@@ er inter@@ face stuff and how long people can pay at@@ tention and they said , " Yeah , it 's about ten minutes . " I think that might even be what mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated YouTube to figu@@ re out the li@@ mit , but that for@@ ced me to do that . One , that 's a gran@@ ular ch@@ un@@ k that allo@@ ws people to pay at@@ tention . It turns it into one of these D@@ a@@ Vin@@ c@@ i Co@@ de D@@ an B@@ ro@@ wn type no@@ vel@@ s where each cha@@ p@@ ter 's three pa@@ ges and you 're like , " Okay , I 'm done , " and you get a sense of comple@@ tion , as op@@ posed to a 9@@ 0 minute lecture that you can only watch 40 minutes and you feel - This also makes it very gran@@ ular . You can really just ju@@ m@@ p in and get exactly what you need as op@@ posed to si@@ tting through a 9@@ 0 minute lecture and trying to find - I 've found that ten minutes is now I 'm getting to - Actually , I 've done a few videos now that are pu@@ sh@@ ing 20 minutes , but that 's just my fa@@ ul@@ t . I really think everything can be done in ten minutes . Your other thing is how many times do I do it ? Do you have to ta@@ pe and re@@ ta@@ pe se@@ ver@@ al times to get it to where you want it ( cro@@ s@@ st@@ al@@ k ) Audience Member : Sal : Oh qu@@ ality ? Audience Member : Yeah . Sal : How many times do I have to - When I started , since it was for my cousins , I literally would recor@@ d it and put up . ( laughter ) There 's actually one or two videos where I 'm ans@@ wer@@ ing tel@@ em@@ ar@@ ke@@ ter cal@@ ls . ( laughter ) I didn 't care . Why re- recor@@ d it ? It 's for Na@@ dia . This is free ( unintelligible ) . That 's another ta@@ ke@@ away . People like that in@@ forma@@ li@@ ty , they like that - I make mist@@ ak@@ es . I would say one out of every 12 videos I make on ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic , I for@@ get a ne@@ ga@@ tive number or I for@@ get a ne@@ ga@@ tive sign or I say 16@@ - 8 is 5 . I do something biz@@ ar@@ re and people really like that . ( laughter ) Or I start a problem and go around the wrong pat@@ h first and I say , " Oh wa@@ it , that 's not right . " I 've go@@ tten posi@@ tive feedback on those things because you never see it . When you go to a class , the teacher they have the sc@@ ri@@ pt , they 've done that problem 20 times and they just do it per@@ fect . You 're an i@@ di@@ ot if you didn 't see this , ob@@ vious ste@@ ps , but when you see someone who kind of knows what they 're doing , they follow their in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion in one dire@@ ction , it was wrong , that 's o@@ kay , that 's the art of mathematics , of sol@@ ving a problem . Then you go down a comple@@ te other pat@@ h . I try now that it 's getting more no@@ t@@ ori@@ e@@ ty , I feel like , " Oh my God , so many people are going to watch this video , " let me re- do it , " but I find the more I think that way it hur@@ ts the qu@@ ality of the video . Audience Member : D@@ o@@ es K@@ ap@@ lan or any of the other paid for on@@ line ser@@ vi@@ ces , P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x U@@ ni@@ versi@@ ty , do any of them view you as a compe@@ ti@@ tive th@@ re@@ at , being free ? Sal : They should . ( laughter ) I 've actually spoke to the re@@ search group at A@@ p@@ ol@@ l@@ o G@@ rou@@ p , which is the par@@ ent company for the U@@ ni@@ versi@@ ty of P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x . I think they 're aw@@ are of it now . I 've talked to P@@ rin@@ ce@@ ton Re@@ view about po@@ tenti@@ ally - Because I would like to do something with their materi@@ als and all of that . In any of these groups , even textbook publish@@ ers , I 've talked to a few , there 's a group that 's very in@@ se@@ cu@@ re about everything , but there 's another view that 's like , " Lo@@ ok , this is out there " and this could even em@@ power your instru@@ ction .

Yeah .
So we r@@ an off to a su@@ shi ba@@ r .
I believe they are called the pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed mo@@ th , and this was in pre@@ - indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution En@@ gla@@ nd , that these moths , that some of the moths were - let me see if I can dra@@ w a mo@@ th to give you the idea , you know , let me dra@@ w a couple of them , let me dra@@ w a few pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed moths . A couple of pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed moths there . Let me dra@@ w one more . So , most pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed moths there was just this vari@@ ation , some of them were I gu@@ ess we could call them more pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed than o@@ thers . So , some of them might look like this , you know . No let me do another col@@ our . Let 's do wh@@ ite . So it has spo@@ ts like that , some of them might have looked more like that . And of course they also had some black spo@@ ts on them . And then some of them might have been , you know , almost - bar@@ ely have any spo@@ ts . You just have this natural vari@@ ation like you would see in any population of ani@@ ma@@ ls . You 'll see some vari@@ ation in col@@ ours . Now they were all happy , probably for thousands of years , just this natural vari@@ ation . Just this it was a n@@ on- important tra@@ it for these pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed moths but then all of a sudden the indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution happens in En@@ gla@@ nd , and all of this so@@ ot gets re@@ le@@ ased from all of these fac@@ t@@ ori@@ es that are run@@ ning these ste@@ am engin@@ es power@@ ed by co@@ al , and so , all of a sudden all of these things that once were gre@@ y or wh@@ ite , for example maybe some tree tr@@ un@@ ks - let me dra@@ w some tree tr@@ un@@ ks - may there were some tree tr@@ un@@ ks that used to look like this , you know , may be it looked like a maybe it ke@@ pt the , maybe some tree tr@@ un@@ ks looked something like this and a pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed mo@@ th would be pretty OK , maybe there were some tree tr@@ un@@ ks were pretty dar@@ k , but all of a sudden the indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution happened , everything gets cover@@ ed with so@@ ot from the co@@ al being bur@@ ned and then all of a sudden all the tre@@ es look like this : They are completely p@@ it@@ ch black or they are a lot dar@@ k@@ er than they were before . Now all of a sudden you have had a maj@@ or change to these moths ' en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment , and you have to think : What is going to select for these moths ? Well , one thing that might get these moths are bir@@ ds and the ability of these bir@@ ds to see the moths . So all of a sudden if the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment became a lot bla@@ ck@@ er than it was before you can gu@@ ess what is going to happen : The bir@@ ds are gonna see this du@@ de a lot ea@@ si@@ er than they are gonna see this du@@ de , cause this du@@ de on the black back@@ grou@@ nd is gonna be a lot har@@ der to see . And it is not like the bir@@ ds won 't cat@@ ch this guy , they 'll cat@@ ch all of them , but they 're gonna cat@@ ch this guy a lot more fre@@ qu@@ en@@ tly . So you can imagine what happens if the bir@@ ds start cat@@ ching these gu@@ ys before they can re@@ produce or may be while they are re@@ produ@@ cing what 's going to happen : This guy , the dar@@ k@@ er du@@ des are going to re@@ produce a lot more often and all of a sudden you 're gonna have a lot more moths that look like this . You 're gonna have a lot more of these du@@ des . So what happened here ? W@@ as there any design or was there any ac@@ tive change by any of the moths ? It looks like a really s@@ mar@@ t thing to do , to become black . Your sur@@ rou@@ n@@ d@@ ings became black and you wa@@ it for a couple of gener@@ ations of these moths and all of a sudden the moths are black and you say : W@@ ow , these moths are geni@@ uses . They all some@@ how deci@@ ded to evol@@ ve into black moths in order to hi@@ de from the bir@@ ds more ea@@ si@@ ly . But that is not what happened . You had a lot of vari@@ ation in your pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed mo@@ th population and what happened was that when everything turned dar@@ k@@ er and dar@@ k@@ er , these du@@ des right here , and du@@ de@@ tt@@ es , had a lot less success in re@@ produ@@ cing . You had a bun@@ ch of them . These gu@@ ys just re@@ produ@@ ced more and more and more and these gu@@ ys got eat@@ en up before they were able to re@@ produce or may while they were re@@ produ@@ cing so that they couldn 't produce as many of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring and then this tra@@ it became d@@ om@@ in@@ ant . and then the pe@@ pp@@ er@@ ed mo@@ th became - you can kind of view it as a black mo@@ th . Now you might say : OK Sal , that is one example , but I need more . This is natural selection , this is p@@ ur@@ por@@ ted to app@@ ly to everything , it p@@ ur@@ por@@ ts to ex@@ pla@@ in why we ev@@ olved from basi@@ c bacteria or maybe from self re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating R@@ N@@ A which I will talk about more in the future . You know , I need more evi@@ dence of this - you know - I need to see it in real time . and the best example of this is really the flu is really the flu . And I 'll do other videos in the future on what viru@@ ses are and how they re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate and viru@@ ses actually are f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating , because it is not actually cle@@ ar that they are ali@@ ve , they 're literally just little bu@@ cke@@ ts of DNA and sometimes R@@ N@@ A which we 'll learn is gen@@ e@@ tic information and they 're just con@@ tain@@ ed in these vi@@ ral ... these little pro@@ te@@ in con@@ tain@@ ers that are these ne@@ at ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ cal sha@@ pes and that 's all they are , they really don 't have - you know - they are not like re@@ gu@@ lar living organ@@ is@@ ms , that acti@@ vely move and that acti@@ vely have me@@ ta@@ bo@@ li@@ s@@ ms and all that . What they do is they take that little DNA and then they in@@ ject it into other things that can process it and then they use that DNA to produce more viru@@ ses . But any@@ way , I could , we could do a whole s@@ eri@@ es of videos on viru@@ ses , but the flu is a virus and what happens every year is that you have a certain type of virus a certain type of virus and they have some vari@@ ation and I 'll just make the vari@@ ation by how many do@@ ts they have . how many do@@ ts they have and they , in fact , - let 's say it is a human flu , they inf@@ ect human@@ s - and slo@@ w@@ ly our im@@ mun@@ e syst@@ ems , which we could make a whole set of videos on as well , start to recogni@@ ze the virus and are able to at@@ ta@@ ck them before they can do a lot of da@@ ma@@ ge . So now you can imagine what happens , if let 's say this is the cur@@ r@@ ent flu , let me do all of them , they all have these little two do@@ ts and that 's how and we 'll talk in the future about what these do@@ ts are . and how they can be recogni@@ zed , but let 's say that 's how our im@@ mun@@ e system recogni@@ z@@ es them . they start reali@@ z@@ ing : O , any time I get this little green du@@ de with 2 do@@ ts on it , that is not a good thing to have around . So I am going to at@@ ta@@ ck it in some way and de@@ st@@ ro@@ y it before he inf@@ ec@@ ts my im@@ mun@@ e system and DNA and all the rest . And so you have a very st@@ rong natural selection once im@@ mun@@ e syst@@ ems learn what this virus is and we 'll talk more about what learning means for an im@@ mun@@ e system . that they 'll start at@@ ta@@ cking these gu@@ ys , right ? But flu , you can kind of think of them as being tri@@ ck@@ y , but they are not really tri@@ ck@@ y , they are not sen@@ ti@@ ent ob@@ jec@@ ts . But what they do do : They con@@ stan@@ tly change . so what you have in any flu population , you 're always having a little bit of change , so may be the great maj@@ ority of them have those two do@@ ts , but may be every now and then one of them has one do@@ t , one of them has 3 do@@ ts , and maybe that is just a random mu@@ tation , this just rand@@ om@@ ly happened , maybe one in every - I 'll make up a number - one in every million of these viru@@ ses has this only one do@@ t instead of two do@@ ts , but what 's gonna happen as soon as the human im@@ mun@@ e system gets used to at@@ ta@@ cking the virus with the two red do@@ ts , well then this guy isn 't gonna have to compe@@ te with the other virus ca@@ p@@ su@@ les for inf@@ ec@@ ting people he 's going to have people 's DNA all to h@@ im@@ self . He or she or what ever you want to call this virus , is then going to be more success@@ ful so by next year 's flu se@@ as@@ on when people start s@@ nee@@ z@@ ing and are able to spread it on do@@ or kno@@ b@@ s and whatever else again , This guy is going to be the new flu virus . So when you see this process of every year there is a new flu virus , that is evolution and natural selection in real time . It is happening ! It isn 't this thing that only happens over e@@ ons and e@@ ons of time . Al@@ though most of the sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al things that we see in our lives or even in our@@ selves are based on these things that happened over e@@ ons and e@@ ons of time , but it happens on a year@@ ly b@@ as@@ is . A@@ no@@ ther example is if you think about anti@@ bioti@@ cs and bacteria . B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a are these little cel@@ ls that move around and we 'll talk more about them , they are de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely living , they have me@@ ta@@ bo@@ li@@ s@@ ms and whatever else . And so this is just a nice thing to know : When people talk about inf@@ ec@@ tions it could ei@@ ther be a vi@@ ral inf@@ ection which are these things that go and inf@@ ect your DNA and then use your c@@ ell me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms to re@@ produce or it could be a bacteri@@ al inf@@ ection which are literally little cel@@ ls and they move around and they re@@ lea@@ se to@@ x@@ ins that make you si@@ ck and whatever else , so bacteria these are what anti@@ bioti@@ cs k@@ ill . An@@ ti@@ - bioti@@ cs . Actually I don 't think there is a hy@@ ph@@ en : An@@ ti@@ bioti@@ cs . They at@@ ta@@ ck bacteria , they k@@ ill them . Now you 've probably , if you know a couple of doc@@ tors or whatever , and you say : Hey I am si@@ ck , I think I have bacteri@@ al inf@@ ection , give me some anti@@ bioti@@ cs , a respon@@ si@@ ble doc@@ tor says : No I sh@@ ouldn 't give you anti@@ bioti@@ cs just wil@@ ly n@@ il@@ ly , because what happens is that the more anti@@ bioti@@ cs you use , you 're more likely to create versi@@ ons and I want to be very car@@ e@@ ful about the word create , because you are not acti@@ vely cre@@ ating them , but let 's say - and let me fin@@ ish my sen@@ t@@ ence - you are very likely to help select for anti@@ bioti@@ c@@ - re@@ sist@@ ant bacteria . Now how does that work ? Now let 's say this is a green let 's say that these are all bacteria and you have ba@@ z@@ illi@@ ons of them , right ? And every now and then , you get one that is sli@@ gh@@ tly different . Now in a random population of bacteria these all will make you equ@@ ally si@@ ck and this is just some random differ@@ ence in the bacteria may be on his DNA some sli@@ gh@@ tly different changes happened , but whatever happened , these all are the kind of bacteria that you don 't want to get a lot of them in your system . Your im@@ mun@@ e system can at@@ ta@@ ck them and fi@@ ght them off . If you get a lot of them they might k@@ ill you or make you si@@ ck or whatever else . Now , if everyone just starts using anti@@ bioti@@ cs when they are not si@@ ck or when they don 't really need to in a life or de@@ ath si@@ tu@@ ation , you might have an anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tic that is really good at kil@@ ling the green bacteria . But what happens if you all of a sudden k@@ ill a lot of the green bacteria ? Well , now the b@@ lu@@ e bacteria have the whole ec@@ o@@ system , that before it was compe@@ ting with all these green du@@ des to get at your - get all the good stuff inside of your body , but now he is all al@@ one and now he can re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate wil@@ ly n@@ il@@ ly , so now he is going to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate wil@@ ly n@@ il@@ ly and ob@@ viously and this is - once again - it isn 't like there was any design , there was any intellig@@ ent process here that said : Hey look , this bacteria should , - you know , I am some bacteria - said : I am going to be a little bit s@@ mar@@ ter and design myself to re@@ si@@ st this anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tic th@@ re@@ at . No , there is just these random changes that happened and mu@@ ta@@ tions in viru@@ ses and bacteria happen fre@@ qu@@ en@@ tly . And there are these random changes that happen and this might be this one in a bil@@ li@@ on change , right ? but all of a sudden if you start kil@@ ling off all the people that it is compe@@ ting with then this guy can start re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating really fast and then become the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant bacteria and then all of a sudden that anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tic that you had develop@@ ed very car@@ ef@@ ully to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y the green du@@ des is u@@ sel@@ ess . And you have this su@@ per@@ bu@@ g . You might have heard the word su@@ per@@ bu@@ g . That is what a su@@ per@@ bu@@ g is . It 's not like it de@@ sig@@ ned itself some@@ how . It is just that we got very good at kil@@ ling its compe@@ ti@@ tion and so we allo@@ wed it to take over and we can 't k@@ ill it , because all of the d@@ ru@@ gs were just good at kil@@ ling its compe@@ ti@@ tion . And these bacteria just keep mu@@ t@@ ating and keep mu@@ t@@ ating and if we use these anti@@ bioti@@ cs a little bit too he@@ av@@ ily , we will always be sel@@ ec@@ ting for the things that won 't be af@@ fec@@ ted by the anti@@ bioti@@ cs . An@@ y@@ way , I think I have spo@@ ken long enough , but it is a f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating top@@ ic and I really wanted to make this my very first , my very first - I gu@@ ess - video or lecture if you will on bi@@ olo@@ gy , because if you really went to , you know : Bi@@ olo@@ gy is the study of life and we can talk about what life is whether viru@@ ses are living and what not , but if you really want to study living syst@@ ems , you really can 't make any assu@@ mp@@ tions other than natural selection . We could go to another pla@@ net where the cre@@ atu@@ res don 't have DNA or may be they have some other type of her@@ edi@@ tar@@ y information stor@@ ed in their cel@@ ls or they re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate in some other way or they are not even car@@ b@@ on based , may be they are si@@ lic@@ on based and if we went to that type of a pla@@ net in order to study the bi@@ olo@@ gy on that pla@@ net everything else we know about bi@@ olo@@ gy and about viru@@ ses and DNA would be u@@ sel@@ ess . But if we do understand this one concept , this one concept of natural selection , that your en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment will select , and you know there is no ac@@ tive process here , it is just some random stuff happened and they rand@@ om@@ ly select for random changes and over large s@@ wat@@ s of time and these are uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ ably large s@@ wa@@ ths of time those changes es@@ sen@@ tially ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ late , and they might ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ late for fair@@ ly fair@@ ly sig@@ nifi@@ c@@ ant things We 'll talk more about this in another video . S@@ e@@ e you soon ! One of the great pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ges that I have had over the years is to en@@ ga@@ ge with many different coun@@ tri@@ es and cul@@ tures with all the ri@@ ch@@ ness that it br@@ ings .
So en@@ vi@@ sion what it looks like all w@@ ra@@ pped up .

Some opport@@ uni@@ ties only come once , se@@ iz@@ e them . T@@ ra@@ vel often ; getting lost will help you find yourself .

And pra@@ ise really does have to be gen@@ u@@ ine , but she takes respon@@ si@@ bility for that .
So if a bill is coming through and something is not a@@ gre@@ ed to by that Member , they can bring forward the amend@@ ment and have it consi@@ der@@ ed by the House and then there will be a vo@@ te at the end of the de@@ b@@ ate where the House can de@@ ter@@ mine whether they a@@ gree with that position or disa@@ gree .
Okay , but we might have mi@@ ssed the real le@@ s@@ son here .

I sh@@ all re@@ turn from lreland often . To my eyes , lreland was not at all the place of bo@@ gs and co@@ t@@ ta@@ ges my mother had told me it would be .

He as@@ ks repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly if we 've won the war yet , and when we try to ex@@ pla@@ in the dif@@ fi@@ cul@@ ties of doing so , he cal@@ ls for Mr Fox !

I cannot ar@@ gu@@ e with a p@@ un , particu@@ lar@@ ly if it f@@ lat@@ ters me . No@@ - one can ar@@ gu@@ e with Mr Fox . He always win@@ s . I imagine Lady Kildare also has a ha@@ bit of win@@ ning . Oh , I don 't con@@ te@@ st . - I de@@ f@@ er to Lor@@ d Kildare in all things . - A@@ h . ls that not so ? All things in the great world , perhaps . But in the matter of children and house , I think women have the w@@ is@@ er view . You would have us believe , my de@@ ar , that your op@@ ini@@ ons are con@@ fin@@ ed to children and house ? They have the maj@@ or share of my thou@@ ghts . O@@ therwise , my thou@@ ghts are com@@ mon@@ place . Let us hear these com@@ mon@@ place thou@@ ghts . I think war is a dis@@ gra@@ ce to human natu@@ re . It makes us ri@@ ch . - But that should not be . It makes everyone ri@@ ch . Our man@@ u@@ fac@@ t@@ ori@@ es make ar@@ ms , our mer@@ chan@@ ts sel@@ l clo@@ th for uni@@ for@@ ms , our b@@ an@@ k@@ ers make lo@@ ans , our cor@@ n pri@@ ces ri@@ se , and your father gro@@ ws ri@@ cher by the day as his co@@ al is used .

You said you w@@ ish@@ ed to bring this war to a spe@@ e@@ dy end . Are you now saying you wish it to continu@@ e ? It doesn 't hin@@ der my pro@@ spe@@ cts . So this war is a u@@ se@@ ful instru@@ ment to your ad@@ van@@ c@@ ement . I said no such thing . W@@ ar is a mu@@ r@@ der@@ ing tra@@ de and you talk of pro@@ spe@@ cts ! ls the end of war not in si@@ ght ? I have never been more con@@ v@@ in@@ ced of your being ti@@ red of me as I have been this last month . I know fi@@ deli@@ ty is not the cu@@ st@@ om am@@ ong@@ st people of our ran@@ k , and there are some mar@@ ri@@ ages where the pres@@ ence of a mi@@ stre@@ ss does not se@@ em to dist@@ ur@@ b the wife . And perhaps I should be more ... ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed . But I cannot be@@ ar it if I am not first in your heart . You think I have a mi@@ stre@@ ss ? A mi@@ stre@@ ss ! When should I find time for a mi@@ stre@@ ss ? But if it was a ser@@ v@@ ant , or an ac@@ tre@@ ss , perhaps I could be@@ ar it , but to be dis@@ pla@@ ced by an equal ! A@@ n equal ? Wh@@ o is she , Hen@@ ry ? L@@ ist@@ en ... There is no@@ - one . There is only you . - You mean I have no ri@@ val ? - You are always in my thou@@ ghts . Wh@@ er@@ ever I am ... wh@@ o@@ ever I am with . You are the cen@@ t@@ re of my life . I think of you all the time . I think of you in the cla@@ m@@ our of de@@ b@@ ate .

I have looked at these appli@@ ca@@ tions , Lor@@ d Kildare , and I sh@@ all do what I can . I 'm g@@ rat@@ e@@ ful . There is a fav@@ our I must ask in re@@ turn ... .. if Lady Kildare doesn 't mind . - Ha@@ ve you consi@@ der@@ ed what she did ? - It is done , Fa@@ ther , and can 't be changed . Ch@@ il@@ dren are not inde@@ pen@@ dent of their parents . She knew that , yet she set her will aga@@ in@@ st mine . You know how she car@@ ed for you . - I did everything for her . - I know . I was the best ju@@ dge of her happ@@ in@@ ess ! I know ! But she mi@@ ss@@ es you . She didn 't mean to give you pain . - Your be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our ga@@ ve me pain . - M@@ ine ? The day after your we@@ d@@ ding you vi@@ si@@ ted her . All London spoke of it . There would have been less no@@ ise if we 'd lost the fle@@ et ! Fa@@ ther , years have pas@@ sed . l@@ f p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment were nee@@ ded , has there not been enough ? - I wor@@ ry about you . - Do not pre@@ su@@ me to wor@@ ry about me . You think to ad@@ vi@@ se me ? You live in lreland ! What can you know ? Fa@@ ther ... .. do you not want to see your el@@ de@@ st g@@ rand@@ child ? Emily , you were a cle@@ ver child , but it g@@ ri@@ ev@@ es me now to see that you have become a bra@@ in@@ less woman ! How d@@ are he speak to you in that man@@ ner ? - He can 't understand being cro@@ ssed . K@@ l@@ L@@ D@@ A@@ R@@ E : R@@ ich@@ mon@@ d is too p@@ rou@@ d . Pri@@ de is natural ... if one 's g@@ rand@@ father was King . And what of his g@@ rand@@ mother ? She was the King 's mi@@ stre@@ ss . One of the many he took to b@@ ed . And her g@@ rand@@ son pre@@ sum@@ es to be p@@ rou@@ d ! R@@ oy@@ al@@ ty issues its own per@@ missi@@ ons . My family has a le@@ ga@@ l line for 6@@ 00 years .

Why do , statisti@@ cally , a maj@@ ority of people say that a word is sa@@ d , in this case , he@@ av@@ y in other c@@ ases ?
And there 's a lot of re@@ war@@ ds in thinking about complexity and em@@ er@@ g@@ ence , not so much in thinking about simplicity .

All right , let me then fin@@ ish off with four general st@@ at@@ e@@ ments , an example and two ap@@ hor@@ is@@ ms .

I have an interest in education . Actually , what I find is everybody has an interest in education .
And that changed everything for me .
And so you can imagine , here I was an an@@ al@@ y@@ st at a he@@ dge fun@@ d .
That , not only would it help my cousins right now , or these people who are sen@@ ding le@@ t@@ ters , but that this con@@ tent will never go old , that it could help their kids or their g@@ rand@@ kids .

( Laughter )
And then I would pro@@ pose as this last comp@@ on@@ ent that they ser@@ ve , or have the po@@ tenti@@ al to ser@@ ve , as building blo@@ cks .
Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always tried to impro@@ ve and do good work .
If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a pro@@ tra@@ cted process of universi@@ ty en@@ tran@@ ce .
Some people are t@@ all , some people are short , some people have b@@ lon@@ d ha@@ ir , some people have black ha@@ ir .
Actually , I hear a lot , " My husb@@ and is t@@ one- de@@ a@@ f . "
Can we have the next sli@@ de ?
And the power out@@ let needs to be s@@ mar@@ t enough to do it .

One is the ex@@ tra@@ ordinary evi@@ dence of human creativity in all of the presen@@ ta@@ tions that we 've had and in all of the people here . Just the vari@@ e@@ ty of it and the ran@@ ge of it .
E@@ ven though this process did happen , that you did have cre@@ atu@@ res that over time ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ la@@ ted changes , that maybe their an@@ ce@@ stor@@ s might have looked more like this and eventually they looked more like this .
Ch@@ ron@@ ic pain is an example .
I was here .
And we can sa@@ ve milli@@ ons of lives through the simple war@@ m@@ th of an E@@ m@@ bra@@ ce .
So , this made evolution sud@@ den@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ win@@ i@@ an .
And the answer : before their first bir@@ th@@ days .
At the end of the day the Government is the ser@@ v@@ ant of Parliament , not the other way around .
There 's nothing wrong with big , cra@@ z@@ y challen@@ ges .
A transpar@@ ent and accoun@@ table system is im@@ per@@ ati@@ ve in en@@ sur@@ ing that light is sh@@ one on all the acti@@ vi@@ ties of Parliament in order to re@@ tain the con@@ fi@@ dence of the ci@@ tiz@@ ens of the United Kingdom .
" And my s@@ ou@@ l from out that sha@@ do@@ w That li@@ es flo@@ ating on the flo@@ or Sha@@ ll be li@@ f@@ ted ?
So then we went forward and built our produ@@ ction line in Ch@@ in@@ a .
The vir@@ tu@@ e of bin@@ ary is that it 's the simp@@ le@@ st possible way of represen@@ ting numbers .
So we 've been stud@@ ying the babies using a tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e that we 're using all over the world and the sounds of all langu@@ ages .
There are vari@@ ations of this the@@ me but ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely it is about a process of transpar@@ ency and accoun@@ ta@@ bility to the people , built on the ideas and en@@ de@@ av@@ ours of individual Parliamentarians .
Lo@@ ok around the room : cha@@ ir@@ s , w@@ o@@ od , everything around us has to change or we 're not going to li@@ ck this problem .
You can go on YouTube and look at these com@@ ments -- someone else w@@ ro@@ te : " S@@ ame thing here .
Maybe there was no Ju@@ li@@ et for this R@@ ome@@ o .
( Laughter )
Re@@ form is no use any@@ more , because that 's simply impro@@ ving a bro@@ ken model .
And I like universi@@ ty profes@@ sor@@ s , but you know , we sh@@ ouldn 't hold them up as the high@@ - water mar@@ k of all human a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ement .
Hen@@ ry , do I be@@ gin to look old ?
Every one .
Why should you have a chamber with any power at all if it is not elected ?
And every day , ever@@ y@@ where , our children spread their dre@@ ams ben@@ eat@@ h our fe@@ et .
In K@@ as@@ un@@ gu .
I@@ t is through a do@@ cu@@ ment called H@@ ans@@ ard , which is a ver@@ ba@@ tim account of every single deli@@ ber@@ ation in the House of Commons and the House of Lords .
Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons .
If I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t my ol@@ der sister 's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I est@@ ab@@ lish@@ ed on her last lo@@ an , I 'm going to with@@ hold her ability to get more money from me , until she p@@ ays it back .
He must ju@@ m@@ p about .
So now , I have one last thought , which is that it really makes a differ@@ ence what we say -- the words that come out of our m@@ outh .
C@@ al@@ culus is an important sub@@ ject .
It is from these origin@@ s , when the building symbo@@ li@@ sed the div@@ ine right of the Mon@@ arch to re@@ i@@ gn , that Parliament has ev@@ olved over many hun@@ dre@@ ds of years into the in@@ stitu@@ tion it is today .
E@@ speci@@ ally here in Wa@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ fast da@@ te , and you say , " How about eight o '@@ clo@@ ck ? " they 're likely to tell you , " E@@ ight o '@@ clo@@ ck is too late for me , but that 's o@@ kay , I can get a g@@ ame of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ ference cal@@ ls and meet you at eight . "
As@@ k the next person you see what their pas@@ sion is .
We do not use that system .
But how do they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te this c@@ ru@@ cial role and how much influence do they have ?
So that would produce ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion for the enti@@ re vil@@ la@@ ge ?
You couldn 't tell the differ@@ ence between somebody from T@@ ex@@ as and somebody from R@@ ome .
We lik@@ ed this so much we actually b@@ ou@@ ght the company and are fol@@ ding it into the ma@@ in produ@@ ct .
Because think of the picture -- not the word , the picture .
If I 'd done this with my head you cer@@ tain@@ ly would have thought it .
So those that were si@@ tting on the f@@ ence before now have no reason not to .
I@@ s this something that other people can do ?
People have very different ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ des .
So the hy@@ po@@ ten@@ use is now going to be five .
So we asked our@@ selves , can the babies take statistics on a br@@ and new language ?
She doesn 't see the point .
" Bo@@ tt@@ les ? "
Here , I bring you te@@ a to d@@ rin@@ k .
They can ask a question ; they can put that question ei@@ ther in written form , in which case the Government has to answer it , or they can put it in or@@ al form , in which case it can be debat@@ ed .
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jec@@ ts I loved .
So , you 're not going to find them in ru@@ ral areas of develop@@ ing coun@@ tri@@ es .
You have build something very f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating , and it looks like its best times are still a@@ head of it .
We have public gal@@ l@@ eri@@ es ; you must be allo@@ wed in there and into all our committees .
M@@ T : I like to think of myself as an hon@@ est magi@@ ci@@ an .
It 's a r@@ are con@@ di@@ tion .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter recently where I met the ex@@ tra@@ ordinary American po@@ et R@@ u@@ th St@@ one , who 's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s , but she 's been a po@@ et her enti@@ re life and she told me that when she was gro@@ wing up in ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a , she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe .
Hey , there 's another ga@@ la@@ x@@ y . Oh look , there 's another ga@@ la@@ x@@ y .
There is no other way to build 30 , using some other groups of prime numbers multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed together .
A@@ dor@@ ation and ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion will o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .

The Government has always to de@@ f@@ end its poli@@ cies in any of those different con@@ tex@@ ts .
And his whole work process changed after that . Not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dar@@ k as ever .


- l@@ f one never ven@@ tures , one never ga@@ ins . - You never w@@ in !
CA :
And this is not in some ab@@ stra@@ ct me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal sense . All that 's se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your s@@ kin .
And so , it seems to me , up@@ on a lot of re@@ fle@@ ction , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continu@@ e writing , is that I have to create some sort of pro@@ te@@ c@@ tive p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal con@@ stru@@ ct , right ? I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe di@@ stance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that writing is going to be , from now on .
It turned out that people loved Coca- Cola in bo@@ tt@@ les .

Do you remember the story ?

Yes . )
And the House of Lords is a chamber which does pre@@ ci@@ sel@@ y that .
Al@@ ways remember the ph@@ ra@@ se : " O@@ p@@ position must have its say but government must have its way .  "
A@@ rou@@ nd the world , there were no public syst@@ ems of education , really , before the 19@@ th century .
Willi@@ am of O@@ ran@@ ge and his wife M@@ ary , who was James '@@  daughter .
But even between those three cat@@ e@@ g@@ ori@@ es , it 's too wide a g@@ ul@@ f .

" E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? "
I should just put it b@@ l@@ un@@ tly , because we 're all sort of friends here now -- it 's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly likely that my gre@@ at@@ est success is be@@ hin@@ d me .
H@@ nu@@ g@@ gin@@ n : is it a happy word , or a sa@@ d word ?
We had a ma@@ ssi@@ ve contro@@ ver@@ s@@ y a hun@@ dre@@ d years ago about whether women should be given the right to vo@@ te and whether they should be in Parliament .
It 's an hon@@ or to meet you .
I 've learned to re@@ spe@@ ct the li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning .
It took seven years .
T@@ hat@@  is quite a power to have because sometimes the Government is an@@ xi@@ ous to get legislation on the st@@ atu@@ te book and if the House of Lords is disa@@ gre@@ eing or blo@@ cking , then com@@ pro@@ mi@@ ses have to be re@@ ach@@ ed that are accep@@ table .
I couldn 't read En@@ g@@ lish that well .
The second is that it 's put us in a place where we have no idea what 's going to happen , in terms of the future .
In a way -- it did not for me .
A@@ f@@ ter I dro@@ pped out of school , I went to library , and I read a book that would -- " U@@ sing En@@ er@@ gy , " and I get information about doing the mi@@ ll .
B@@ y@@ te ma@@ gaz@@ ine and Comm@@ uni@@ ca@@ tions at the A@@ C@@ M had spe@@ cial issues cover@@ ing hy@@ per@@ text .
One of the great things of course is that we are not ci@@ vi@@ l ser@@ van@@ ts , we are ser@@ van@@ ts of the legisla@@ ture , not of the ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive and so that inde@@ pen@@ dence , whether one is ser@@ ving a select committee or one of our really top gra@@ de re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ers de@@ con@@ stru@@ cting un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment statistics , they are not doing it under any min@@ ist@@ eri@@ al dire@@ ction , they are doing it for the House of Commons .
Now they could en@@ joy it any time they wanted .
We 're gonna get through this , right ?
So here is to your continu@@ ed success .
Then we went on to the dre@@ ad@@ ed f@@ ra@@ ctions .
" Yes S@@ ir ! Bo@@ tt@@ les .
So b@@ ri@@ lli@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that di@@ stance that I 'm talking about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal con@@ stru@@ ct to pro@@ te@@ ct you from the resul@@ ts of your work .
This is where I live .
This may sho@@ ck you , but we 're literally re@@ ad@@ ing this person 's brain in real time .

And it 's time for our mathematics cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um to change from an@@ alo@@ g to di@@ gi@@ tal , from the more classical , continu@@ ous mathematics , to the more mo@@ der@@ n , dis@@ cre@@ te mathematics -- the mathematics of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty , of rand@@ om@@ ness , of data -- that being pro@@ ba@@ bility and statistics .
And I think that 's a very good way of thinking about the problem .
That 's coming out soon .
" How did you get to be a dan@@ cer ? " It was interesting . When she was at school , she was really hop@@ el@@ ess .

Can we do this differ@@ en@@ tly ?
She would cat@@ ch the po@@ em by its ta@@ il , and she would pul@@ l it back@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was trans@@ c@@ rib@@ ing on the page .

I think that adul@@ ts should start learning from kids .
Ha@@ ve you ever wonder@@ ed about the great my@@ st@@ eri@@ es of life ?

TED@@ st@@ ers do it for love ; they don 't do it for money .

The brain isn 't divi@@ ded into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments . In fact , creativity -- which I de@@ f@@ ine as the process of having origin@@ al ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different dis@@ ci@@ p@@ lin@@ ary ways of seeing things .

And you noti@@ ce no@@ body is t@@ one- de@@ a@@ f , right ?
What was he thinking about ?
These kids in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an don 't go to school .

I 'm f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated by how people got to be there . It 's really pro@@ mp@@ ted by a conversa@@ tion I had with a wonder@@ ful woman who maybe most people have never heard of , Gillian L@@ y@@ n@@ ne .

Go@@ es to E@@ .

You see , he 's right .
There are vari@@ ations of this the@@ me but ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely it is about a process of transpar@@ ency and accoun@@ ta@@ bility to the people , built on the ideas and en@@ de@@ av@@ ours of individual Parliamentarians .
We have a million students a month using the site , watching on the order of 100 to 200@@ , 000 videos a day .
Every education system on E@@ ar@@ th has the same hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y of sub@@ jec@@ ts .
I was always very much in fav@@ our of the bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing of Parliament ; a number of Members were not .

Now ...
I noti@@ ced that the house numbers don 't go in order . "
So , E@@ u@@ cli@@ d knew that every number could be ex@@ pres@@ sed using a group of s@@ mal@@ ler pri@@ m@@ es .

In de@@ sig@@ ning this we follo@@ wed a few basi@@ c p@@ rin@@ ci@@ ples .
In terms of Parliamentary acti@@ vity , there are of course all the fron@@ t@@ line ser@@ vi@@ ces like the chamber itself ; the ad@@ vice which is given by the cha@@ ir to all Members , Government or opposition , from the c@@ ler@@ ks at the table dre@@ ssed as I am now but with a wi@@ g and a go@@ wn on .

I 've learned to follow the hun@@ ch , but never assu@@ me where it will go .

It comes back again to the Lords ; the Lords will look at it again .
P@@ ay 4@@ , 000 bu@@ cks and come to TED .
For me , it 's very simple .
We develop@@ ed a system such that it had a mar@@ k@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
There 's no way of predi@@ cting the Internet based on the first tran@@ sist@@ or .

So I 've been working with a lot of the big fo@@ od comp@@ ani@@ es .
I don 't know whether you can see the dro@@ p of blo@@ od on the end -- and im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely whi@@ pped out a bo@@ x of mat@@ ches , lit one , and bur@@ ned the blo@@ od off the end of his f@@ ing@@ er , giving me ful@@ l assu@@ ran@@ ce that that was the way that you st@@ op@@ ped the trans@@ missi@@ on of H@@ l@@ V .

The Government has been elected and its man@@ if@@ es@@ to has ther@@ e@@ fore been pre@@ fer@@ red to that of any the other party , and there is an un@@ written ru@@ le in Parliament that a Government is enti@@ t@@ led to get its business .
While other kids read books like G@@ o , J@@ an@@ e , G@@ o !
And that job is that they go around and pi@@ ck up sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es from the back of ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , w@@ ash them , and in the course of this , ob@@ viously pi@@ cking them up they in@@ ju@@ re the@@ m@@ selves .
( Laughter )
It spread almost entirely through word of m@@ outh , vir@@ ally , across teachers , parents , people inv@@ olved in education .
Now there 's a whole set of new schools op@@ ening up this au@@ tu@@ m@@ n .
" B@@ ac@@ k in the 19@@ 30@@ s , it really became a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ho@@ li@@ day . I mean there was ... u@@ h .. such a ho@@ o@@ li@@ gan@@ is@@ m and van@@ da@@ li@@ sm . "

And it is good that we have some of the tradi@@ tions and symbo@@ li@@ sm of past years ; for example , the St@@ ate O@@ pen@@ ing of Parliament by the Qu@@ een in the House of Lords .

This is my home .
It is wil@@ ling to look at itself and say that these things are not good enough . We must make some impro@@ ve@@ ments . We must make pro@@ gress .
Our inven@@ tion had to ad@@ dre@@ ss all of these issues .
B@@ y now I know you 're d@@ ying to know what it is and where you can get one .
I don 't know how we got into this position . ( Laughter )
I believe this pas@@ sion@@ at@@ ely , that we don 't grow into creativity , we grow out of it . Or rather , we get edu@@ c@@ ated out of it .
And seen just recently in late 200@@ 8 , here is that re@@ gi@@ on again , now half in dar@@ k@@ ness because the s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n he@@ mi@@ sp@@ here is experi@@ en@@ cing the on@@ set of A@@ u@@ gu@@ st and eventually win@@ ter .
They en@@ sure the s@@ mo@@ o@@ th run@@ ning of op@@ er@@ ations and support the work of Parliamentarians .
When a bill is in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced into Parliament it goes through many st@@ ages , both in the House of Lords , where I sit , and in the House of Commons .
There 's a war@@ m , mo@@ i@@ st win@@ d blo@@ wing at your back and the s@@ m@@ ell of the ear@@ th , the whe@@ at , the gra@@ ss , the char@@ g@@ ed parti@@ c@@ les .
And this , of course , is the b@@ as@@ is of much of E@@ a@@ ster@@ n ph@@ ilo@@ sop@@ h@@ y , and that is there is no real inde@@ pen@@ dent self , alo@@ of from other human beings , in@@ spe@@ cting the world , in@@ spe@@ cting other people .
So when I heard that I was like -- that 's un@@ can@@ n@@ y , that 's exactly what my creative process is like .
A good an@@ alo@@ gy is to imagine each number as a different lo@@ ck .
The in@@ valu@@ able scrutin@@ y that Parliamentarians per@@ form would be im@@ possible without an effec@@ tive st@@ af@@ f .
I used di@@ a@@ gra@@ ms and pi@@ c@@ tures to learn the words around them .
And my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us .
So for the past year and a half , my te@@ am at P@@ u@@ sh P@@ op Pre@@ ss and Ch@@ arli@@ e M@@ el@@ cher and M@@ el@@ cher M@@ edi@@ a have been working on cre@@ ating the first fe@@ atu@@ re- len@@ g@@ th interac@@ tive book .

A human being , a child , can just watch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another po@@ lar be@@ ar , and s@@ kin it and put the s@@ kin on its body , f@@ ur on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p .
With one it@@ em in its thought , it s@@ na@@ ps in@@ stan@@ tly to the next it@@ em . And the way information is stru@@ c@@ tu@@ red is to@@ tally in@@ ca@@ p@@ able of ke@@ e@@ ping up with this process .
I have over 70 thou@@ sand people that I am me@@ ant to look after .
This is hard .
This is one from Y@@ or@@ k@@ shi@@ re where , in fact , my ne@@ p@@ he@@ w , I hope , will be able to at@@ t@@ end it .
And po@@ ets , like other arti@@ sts , play with those in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive underst@@ and@@ ings .
A lot of kids want to be milli@@ ona@@ i@@ res .
But he said this :
Wh@@ ole your money st@@ ays with you !
They want to do things , they want to get their han@@ ds dir@@ ty , they want education to be for real .

They look up@@ on their body as a form of trans@@ por@@ t for their he@@ a@@ ds . ( Laughter ) Don 't they ?
T@@ w@@ o@@ - and@@ - a@@ - half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion .
" That che@@ mi@@ cal@@ - engin@@ e@@ er@@ ing blo@@ ck , J@@ oh@@ n , how 's it going ? " It just didn 't come up like that , you know ?

There are now do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ ani@@ es that de@@ p@@ end up@@ on lobbying for their very exist@@ ence .

So , we 've got a picture , I think ?
Parliament is far more than just those MPs who are Minist@@ ers .
Ho@@ we@@ ver , if we try to divi@@ de 29 into equal pi@@ ec@@ es , we run into a problem : it is im@@ possible .
If you don 't have enough time , stop watching T@@ V . If you are looking for the love of your life , stop .
And I w@@ o@@ ke up one day and I said ,
I ou@@ ght to ex@@ pla@@ in that I have no idea what was happening at the time .
There 's B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , house number one . "
You work by learning , and you learn by working .

The House of Lords is , if you like , supp@@ or@@ tive in that the House of Lords scrutin@@ is@@ es , ad@@ vi@@ ses and makes changes if possible to the amend@@ ments which come from the House Commons .

Now , the world needs opport@@ uni@@ ties for new lead@@ ers and new ideas .

And so you can start re@@ ad@@ ing on your i@@ P@@ ad in your living room and then pi@@ ck up where you left off on the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
So if I want to divi@@ de these into two different groups that have the same number of bo@@ x@@ es , I could just e@@ ye@@ b@@ all it , and say , well , let 's make these top ones one group .
( Laughter ) " G@@ i@@ ve me a bre@@ ak . " ( Laughter ) Actually , do you know that old ph@@ ilo@@ sop@@ hi@@ cal thing , if a tree f@@ al@@ ls in a for@@ est and no@@ body he@@ ars it , did it happen ?

I believe fundamen@@ tally , as many spe@@ ak@@ ers have said during the past few days , that we make very po@@ or use of our tal@@ ents .
He didn 't want to come to Los An@@ gel@@ es .
Con@@ sum@@ ers can help by sa@@ ving energy around the house , s@@ wit@@ ching to comp@@ ac@@ t f@@ lu@@ or@@ es@@ cent light bul@@ b@@ s , and dri@@ ving fe@@ wer mil@@ es in the ca@@ r each week .
I@@ s that right ? Don 't do music , you 're not going to be a musi@@ ci@@ an ; don 't do art , you won 't be an arti@@ st .
In my books , I ex@@ pl@@ ore the natu@@ re of per@@ ception and how different kin@@ ds of per@@ cei@@ ving create different kin@@ ds of kno@@ wing and underst@@ anding .
They want to ask me something .
But there was a great de@@ al of con@@ tention . @@ There were groups that did not want to go that far but we won through and we have now the select committees .
My es@@ ti@@ ma@@ tion is that probably 4@@ 5 of you are ab@@ solu@@ tely pas@@ sion@@ ate about classical music .
So you c@@ op@@ i@@ ed -- you exactly c@@ op@@ i@@ ed the design in the book .
If we had time , I could go into this , but we don 't .
But MPs also have the power to for@@ mu@@ late the legislation , to make the la@@ ws and to de@@ ter@@ mine the pri@@ ori@@ ties for government , in@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing the sp@@ en@@ ding pri@@ ori@@ ties and what the country does inter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally .
And I tried , and I made it .
So those are my 18 bo@@ x@@ es , and I divi@@ de them into two equ@@ als st@@ ac@@ ks or two equal groups .
This is the b@@ as@@ is .
( Laughter ) The other thing that happened -- and even at this point , I said , " Okay , maybe it 's a good supp@@ le@@ ment . It 's good for mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated students .

In this particu@@ lar case , you 're re@@ ad@@ ing ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y function . It turns col@@ ors .

So the question is : What 's happening during this cri@@ tical tw@@ o@@ - month period ?
It looked more like this when it was all w@@ ra@@ pped up -- not quite so pretty .
So I get off the plan@@ e , and I come to TED .
And what a per@@ fect place to do that , at TED .
Some cli@@ mate mode@@ ls predi@@ ct sub@@ t@@ le changes , o@@ thers for@@ e@@ ca@@ st ri@@ sing se@@ a le@@ vel@@ s which could flo@@ od co@@ ast@@ al areas around the world .
It 's good for maybe home scho@@ ol@@ ers . " But I didn 't think it would be something that would some@@ how pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ate the classroom . But then I started getting le@@ t@@ ters from teachers . And the teachers would write , saying , " We use your videos to fli@@ p the classroom . You 've given the lec@@ tures , so now what we do ... " and this could happen in every classroom in Ameri@@ ca tomorrow , " ... what I do is I as@@ sign the lec@@ tures for homework . And what used to be homework , I now have the students doing in the classroom . " And I want to pa@@ use here for -- ( Applause ) I want to pa@@ use here for a second , because there 's a couple of interesting things . One , when those teachers are doing that , there 's the ob@@ vious ben@@ ef@@ it -- the ben@@ ef@@ it that now their students can en@@ joy the videos in the way that my cousins did . They can pa@@ use , repe@@ at at their own pace , at their own time . But the more interesting thing is -- and this is the un@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by re@@ mo@@ ving the one siz@@ e f@@ its all lecture from the classroom and le@@ tting students have a sel@@ f- pac@@ ed lecture at home , and then when you go to the classroom , le@@ tting them do work , having the teacher wal@@ k around , having the pe@@ ers actually be able to interac@@ t with each other , these teachers have used technology to human@@ iz@@ e the classroom . They took a fundamen@@ tally de@@ human@@ iz@@ ing experience -- 30 kids with their f@@ ing@@ ers on their li@@ ps , not allo@@ wed to interac@@ t with each other . A teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one siz@@ e f@@ its all lecture to 30 students -- b@@ lan@@ k fac@@ es , sli@@ gh@@ tly an@@ ta@@ g@@ oni@@ stic -- and now it 's a human experience . Now they 're actually interac@@ ting with each other . So once the Khan Academy -- I qu@@ it my job and we turned into a real organ@@ iz@@ ation -- we 're a no@@ t- for@@ - prof@@ it -- the question is , how do we take this to the next level ? How do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion ? And so what I 'm sho@@ wing you over here , these are ac@@ tual exerci@@ ses that I started writing for my cousins . The ones I started were much more pri@@ mi@@ tive . This is a more compe@@ tent ver@@ sion of it . But the para@@ di@@ g@@ m here is , we 'll gener@@ ate as many questions as you need until you get that concept , until you get 10 in a row . And the Khan Academy videos are there . You get hin@@ ts , the ac@@ tual ste@@ ps for that problem , if you don 't know how to do it . But the para@@ di@@ g@@ m here , it seems like a very simple thing : 10 in a row , you move on . But it 's fundamen@@ tally different than what 's happening in class@@ ro@@ om@@ s right now . In a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a s@@ na@@ p@@ sh@@ ot ex@@ am . And that ex@@ am , whether you get a 70 percent , an 80 percent , a 9@@ 0 percent , or a 9@@ 5 percent , the class mo@@ ves on to the next top@@ ic . And even that 9@@ 5 percent student , what was the five percent they didn 't know ? Maybe they didn 't know what happens when you raise something to the z@@ er@@ o power . And then you go build on that in the next concept . That 's an@@ alo@@ g@@ ous to imagine learning to ri@@ de a bi@@ cycle , and maybe I give you a lecture a@@ head of time , and I give you that bi@@ cycle for two weeks . And then I come back after two weeks , and I say , " Well , let 's see . You 're having trouble taking left turns . You can 't quite stop . You 're an 80 percent bi@@ cy@@ cli@@ st . " So I put a big C st@@ am@@ p on your for@@ e@@ head and then I say , " Here 's a uni@@ cycle . " But as ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous as that sounds , that 's exactly what 's happening in our class@@ ro@@ om@@ s right now . And the idea is you fast forward and good students start fa@@ il@@ ing algebra all of a sudden and start fa@@ il@@ ing calculus all of a sudden , de@@ sp@@ ite being s@@ mar@@ t , de@@ sp@@ ite having good teachers . And it 's usu@@ ally because they have these S@@ wi@@ ss che@@ ese ga@@ ps that ke@@ pt building throu@@ gh@@ out their foun@@ da@@ tion . So our model is learn math the way you 'd learn anything , like the way you would learn a bi@@ cycle . S@@ ta@@ y on that bi@@ cycle . F@@ all off that bi@@ cycle . Do it as long as ne@@ cess@@ ary until you have ma@@ stery . The traditional model , it pen@@ ali@@ z@@ es you for exper@@ im@@ en@@ tation and fa@@ il@@ ure , but it does not expect ma@@ stery . We en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to exper@@ im@@ ent . We en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to fa@@ il@@ ure . But we do expect ma@@ stery . This is just another one of the modules . This is tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try . This is shi@@ f@@ ting and re@@ f@@ lec@@ ting fun@@ ctions . And they all f@@ it together . We have about 9@@ 0 of these right now . And you can go to the site right now . It 's all free . Not trying to sel@@ l anything . But the general idea is that they all f@@ it into this know@@ le@@ dge ma@@ p . That top no@@ de right there , that 's literally single di@@ g@@ it ad@@ di@@ tion . It 's like one pl@@ us one is equal to two . And the para@@ di@@ g@@ m is , once you get 10 in a row on that , it ke@@ e@@ ps for@@ war@@ ding you to more and more ad@@ van@@ ced modules . So if you keep fur@@ ther down the know@@ le@@ dge ma@@ p , we 're getting into more ad@@ van@@ ced ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic . F@@ ur@@ ther down , you start getting into pre@@ - algebra and ear@@ ly algebra . F@@ ur@@ ther down , you start getting into algebra one , algebra two , a little bit of pre@@ calculus . And the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be ta@@ u@@ ght in this type of a f@@ ra@@ me@@ work . So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this know@@ le@@ dge ma@@ p you have logi@@ c , you have computer progra@@ m@@ ming , you have gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r , you have gen@@ e@@ ti@@ cs , all based off of that c@@ ore of , if you know this and that , now you 're ready for this next concept . Now that can work well for an individual lear@@ ner , and I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge , one , for you to do it with your kids , but I also en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge everyone in the a@@ udience to do it yourself . It 'll change what happens at the din@@ ner table . But what we want to do is to use the natural con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion of the fli@@ pping of the classroom that those ear@@ ly teachers had ema@@ il@@ ed me about . And so what I 'm sho@@ wing you here , this is actually data from a p@@ il@@ ot in the Los Al@@ to@@ s school distri@@ ct , where they took two fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de class@@ es and two se@@ ven@@ th gra@@ de class@@ es and completely gu@@ tt@@ ed their old math cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . These kids ar@@ en 't using text@@ books , they 're not getting one siz@@ e f@@ its all lec@@ tures . They 're doing Khan Academy , they 're doing that software , for rou@@ gh@@ ly half of their math class . And I want to make it cle@@ ar , we don 't view this as the comple@@ te math education . What it does is -- and this is what 's happening in Los Al@@ to@@ s -- it fre@@ es up time . This is the blo@@ cking and ta@@ ck@@ ling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equ@@ ations , and it fre@@ es up time for the si@@ mu@@ la@@ tions , for the g@@ ames , for the me@@ ch@@ ani@@ cs , for the ro@@ bo@@ t building , for the es@@ ti@@ ma@@ ting how high that h@@ ill is based on its sha@@ do@@ w . And so the para@@ di@@ g@@ m is the teacher wal@@ ks in every day , every kid works at their own pace -- and this is actually a live da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ard from Los Al@@ to@@ s school distri@@ ct -- and they look at this da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ard . Every row is a student . Every col@@ um@@ n is one of those concep@@ ts . Gre@@ en means the student 's already pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent . B@@ lu@@ e means they 're working on it -- no need to wor@@ ry . R@@ ed means they 're stu@@ ck . And what the teacher does is literally just say , " Let me inter@@ ven@@ e on the red kids . " Or even better , " Let me get one of the green kids who are already pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent in that concept to be the first line of at@@ ta@@ ck and actually tu@@ tor their pe@@ er . " ( Applause ) Now I come from a very da@@ ta@@ - cen@@ tri@@ c reali@@ ty , so we don 't want that teacher to even go and inter@@ ven@@ e and have to ask the kid aw@@ k@@ ward questions : " Oh , what do you not understand ? " or " What do you do understand ? " and all of the rest . So our para@@ di@@ g@@ m is to really ar@@ m the teachers with as much data as possible -- really data that , in almost any other fi@@ el@@ d , is expe@@ cted , if you 're in fin@@ an@@ ce or mar@@ ke@@ ting or man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing . And so the teachers can actually di@@ ag@@ no@@ se what 's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as produ@@ c@@ tive as possible . So now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to , how long they have been sp@@ en@@ ding every day , what videos have they been watching , when did they pa@@ use the videos , what did they stop watching , what exerci@@ ses are they using , what have they been focu@@ sed on ? The ou@@ ter cir@@ cle sho@@ ws what exerci@@ ses they were focu@@ sed on . The in@@ ner cir@@ cle sho@@ ws what videos they 're focu@@ sed on . And the data gets pretty gran@@ ular so you can see the exac@@ t problems that the student got right or wrong . R@@ ed is wrong , b@@ lu@@ e is right . The le@@ f@@ t@@ most question is the first question that the student at@@ temp@@ ted . They wat@@ ched the video right over there . And then you can see , eventually , they were able to get 10 in a row . It 's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems . They also got fa@@ ster . The he@@ ight is how long it took them . So when you talk about sel@@ f- pac@@ ed learning , it makes sense for everyone -- in edu@@ ca@@ tion@@ - speak , differ@@ enti@@ ated learning -- but it 's kind of cra@@ z@@ y when you see it in a classroom . Because every time we 've done this , in every classroom we 've done , over and over again , if you go five days into it , there 's a group of kids who 've ra@@ ced a@@ head and there 's a group of kids who are a little bit slo@@ wer . And in a traditional model , if you did a s@@ na@@ p@@ sh@@ ot assessment , you say , " These are the gi@@ f@@ ted kids , these are the s@@ low kids . Maybe they should be tra@@ c@@ ked differ@@ en@@ tly . Maybe we should put them in different class@@ es . " But when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit ex@@ tr@@ a time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just ra@@ ce a@@ head . And so the same kids that you thought were s@@ low six weeks ago , you now would think are gi@@ f@@ ted . And we 're seeing it over and over and over again . And it makes you really won@@ der how much all of the lab@@ els maybe a lot of us have ben@@ ef@@ it@@ ted from were really just du@@ e to a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence of time . Now as valu@@ able as something like this is in a distri@@ ct like Los Al@@ to@@ s , our go@@ al is to use technology to human@@ iz@@ e , not just in Los Al@@ to@@ s , but on a glob@@ al scal@@ e , what 's happening in education . And actually , that kind of br@@ ings an interesting point . A lot of the ef@@ for@@ t in human@@ iz@@ ing the classroom is focu@@ sed on stud@@ en@@ t- to- teacher ra@@ ti@@ os . In our mind , the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant me@@ tri@@ c is stud@@ en@@ t- to- valu@@ ab@@ le@@ - human@@ - time - with@@ - the@@ - teacher ra@@ ti@@ o . So in a traditional model , most of the teacher 's time is sp@@ ent giving lec@@ tures and gra@@ ding and wha@@ t@@ not . Maybe five percent of their time is actually si@@ tting next to students and actually working with them . Now 100 percent of their time is . So once again , using technology , not just fli@@ pping the classroom , you 're human@@ iz@@ ing the classroom , I 'd ar@@ gu@@ e , by a fac@@ tor of five or 10 . And as valu@@ able as that is in Los Al@@ to@@ s , imagine what that does to the adul@@ t lear@@ ner who 's em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to colle@@ ge . I@@ magine what it does to a stre@@ et kid in C@@ al@@ cu@@ tta who has to help his family during the day , and that 's the reason why he or she can 't go to school . Now they can spend two h@@ ours a day and re@@ medi@@ ate , or get up to spe@@ ed and not feel em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sed about what they do or don 't know . Now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the pe@@ ers teaching each other inside of a classroom . But this is all one system . There 's no reason why you can 't have that pe@@ er@@ - to- pe@@ er tu@@ tor@@ ing be@@ yo@@ nd that one classroom . I@@ magine what happens if that student in C@@ al@@ cu@@ tta all of a sudden can tu@@ tor your son , or your son can tu@@ tor that kid in C@@ al@@ cu@@ tta ? And I think what you 'll see em@@ er@@ g@@ ing is this no@@ tion of a glob@@ al one- world classroom . I 've seen some things you 're doing in the system that have to do with with mo@@ ti@@ vation and feedback -- energy poin@@ ts , mer@@ it ba@@ d@@ ges . And that 's es@@ sen@@ tially what we 're trying to build . Thank you . ( Applause ) Bill G@@ ates : T@@ ell me what you 're thinking there ? S@@ K : Oh yeah . No , we have an aw@@ es@@ ome te@@ am working on it . And I have to make it cle@@ ar , it 's not just me any@@ more . I 'm still doing all the videos , but we have a ro@@ ck@@ st@@ ar te@@ am doing the software . Yeah , we 've put a bun@@ ch of g@@ ame me@@ ch@@ ani@@ cs in there where you get these ba@@ d@@ ges , we 're going to start having lead@@ er bo@@ ar@@ ds by are@@ a , and you get poin@@ ts . It 's actually been pretty interesting . Just the wor@@ ding of the ba@@ d@@ g@@ ing or how many poin@@ ts you get for doing something , we see on a syst@@ em@@ - wide b@@ as@@ is , like ten@@ s of thousands of fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ d@@ ers or si@@ x@@ th gra@@ d@@ ers going one dire@@ ction or another , de@@ pen@@ ding what ba@@ dge you give them . ( Laughter ) And the col@@ labor@@ ation you 're doing with Los Al@@ to@@ s , how did that come about ? B@@ G : S@@ K : Los Al@@ to@@ s , it was kind of cra@@ z@@ y . On@@ ce again , I didn 't expect it to be used in class@@ ro@@ om@@ s . S@@ ome@@ one from their bo@@ ard came and said , " What would you do if you had car@@ te b@@ lan@@ ch@@ e in a classroom ? " And I said , " Well , I would just , every student work at their own pace on something like this and we 'd give a da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ard . " And they said , " Oh , this is kind of radi@@ cal . We have to think about it . " And me and the rest of the te@@ am were like , " They 're never going to want to do this . " But literally the next day they were like , " Can you start in two weeks ? " ( Laughter ) B@@ G : So fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de math is where that 's going on right now ? S@@ K : It 's two fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de class@@ es and two se@@ ven@@ th gra@@ de class@@ es . And they 're doing it at the distri@@ ct level . I think what they 're exc@@ ited about is they can now follow these kids . It 's not an on@@ l@@ y@@ - in@@ - school thing . We 've even , on Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ mas , we saw some of the kids were doing it . And we can tra@@ ck everything . So they can actually tra@@ ck them as they go through the enti@@ re distri@@ ct . Th@@ rou@@ gh the sum@@ m@@ ers , as they go from one teacher to the next , you have this continu@@ ity of data that even at the distri@@ ct level they can see . So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and tra@@ ck actually what 's going on with those kids . B@@ G : So you 're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need ? S@@ K : Oh yeah . M@@ o@@ st of those were spe@@ cs by the teachers . We made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very ti@@ ght design loo@@ p with the teachers the@@ m@@ selves . And they 're literally saying , " Hey , this is nice , but ... " Li@@ ke that focus gra@@ p@@ h , a lot of the teachers said , " I have a fe@@ eling that a lot of the kids are ju@@ mp@@ ing around and not focu@@ sing on one top@@ ic . " So we made that focus di@@ a@@ gra@@ m . So it 's all been teach@@ er@@ - dri@@ ven . It 's been pretty cra@@ z@@ y . B@@ G : I@@ s this ready for pri@@ me@@ - time ? Do you think a lot of class@@ es next school year should try this thing out ? S@@ K : Yeah , it 's ready . We got a million people on the site already , so we can h@@ and@@ le a few more . ( Laughter ) No , no reason why it really can 't happen in every classroom in Ameri@@ ca tomorrow . B@@ G : And the vi@@ sion of the tu@@ tor@@ ing thing . The idea there is , if I 'm con@@ fu@@ sed about a top@@ ic , some@@ how right in the us@@ er inter@@ face I 'd find people who are v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ing , maybe see their re@@ pu@@ tation , and I could s@@ ch@@ edu@@ le and conne@@ ct up with those people ? S@@ K : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . And this is something that I re@@ com@@ men@@ d everyone in this a@@ udience to do . Th@@ ose da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds the teachers have , you can go lo@@ g in right now and you can es@@ sen@@ tially become a co@@ ach for your kids , or ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws , or cousins , or maybe some kids at the B@@ oy@@ s and G@@ ir@@ ls C@@ lu@@ b . And yeah , you can start be@@ coming a men@@ tor , a tu@@ tor , really im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely . But yeah , it 's all there . B@@ G : Well , it 's a@@ maz@@ ing . I think you just got a gli@@ mp@@ se of the future of education . Thank you . ( S@@ K : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
And the thir@@ d part of this is that we 've all a@@ gre@@ ed , n@@ one@@ the@@ less , on the really ex@@ tra@@ ordinary ca@@ pac@@ i@@ ties that children have -- their ca@@ pac@@ i@@ ties for in@@ no@@ vation .

It de@@ pen@@ ds how you de@@ f@@ ine lobbying .
T@@ they see their role as being elected by their constituents in order to represent them in Parliament and they focus on hol@@ ding the government to account , scrutin@@ is@@ ing legislation , and spend a lot of time ther@@ e@@ fore in Parliament .
There is no ob@@ vious pat@@ ter@@ n here .
And let 's do it soon .
If a man le@@ av@@ es that same st@@ ation on fo@@ ot but takes one ma@@ ssi@@ ve sh@@ or@@ t@@ c@@ ut , will he spend the rest of his life al@@ one ?
And they worked ab@@ solu@@ tely very , very , very hard .
The MPs in the House of Commons have a du@@ al role both in represen@@ ting their constituents and ac@@ ting as legisla@@ tors .
This guy does have a ta@@ il . And let me do it in a ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate wi@@ d@@ th . You are gonna have to exc@@ use my dra@@ wing skills .

But it can con@@ temp@@ late the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar sp@@ ac@@ e .
And the in@@ jec@@ tion is so valu@@ able , that the people basi@@ cally trust the doc@@ tor , being second to God , which I 've heard many times , to do the right thing . But in fact they 're not .
The Government has been elected and its man@@ if@@ es@@ to has ther@@ e@@ fore been pre@@ fer@@ red to that of any the other party , and there is an un@@ written ru@@ le in Parliament that a Government is enti@@ t@@ led to get its business .
The opposition is there to look car@@ ef@@ ully at what the government does want to do , and if it fin@@ ds that the policy is reas@@ on@@ able and they can support it , and it f@@ its in with their poli@@ cies and their ph@@ ilo@@ sop@@ h@@ y at least give it that support .
I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I b@@ le@@ w into it .
For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an app@@ le , a mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neuron in the front of my brain will fire .
The baby si@@ ts on a par@@ ent 's la@@ p , and we tra@@ in them to turn their he@@ a@@ ds when a sound changes -- like from " ah " to " e@@ e . "

I think a good back@@ ben@@ cher actually com@@ bin@@ es those two ro@@ les and uses Parliament in order to raise the issues that really matter to their constituents lo@@ cally .

So if Parliament disa@@ gre@@ es with the Government then Parliament can , as it has done on many oc@@ ca@@ sions over the years , re@@ f@@ use to go along with what the Government w@@ ish@@ es .
In the House of Lords any single Member can pro@@ pose an amend@@ ment to a bill and it has to be debat@@ ed and looked at .

We do not use that system .
Some of you will know it .
They say , " Oh , well that 's B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 16 . "

They can ring up MPs offi@@ ces and pas@@ s on their com@@ ments to a Member of Parliament before a c@@ ru@@ cial vo@@ te in the Commons .

Parliament on the whole hol@@ ds government to account by the party system , by having an opposition in the House of Commons , by ob@@ jec@@ ting to certain as@@ pe@@ cts of legislation and vo@@ ting on that legislation .
We talk about world pe@@ ac@@ e .

An@@ y Member of our House can bring forward an issu@@ e that they wish to have dis@@ cu@@ ssed or debat@@ ed .
So this is " O@@ b@@ li@@ vi@@ on " by A@@ st@@ or Pi@@ a@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ la .
I made four bla@@ des , just because I want to incre@@ ase power .
But there 's another class of simple things , which are also very important .
O@@ therwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
One ap@@ pro@@ ach is to look at p@@ ati@@ ents who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
While MPs and Pe@@ ers st@@ af@@ f can provi@@ de speci@@ fic political support , Parliamentary st@@ af@@ f are in@@ valu@@ able in of@@ fer@@ ing ad@@ vice and as@@ si@@ stance entirely de@@ vo@@ id of political influence .
P@@ lea@@ se clo@@ se your eyes , and open your han@@ ds .
l@@ n London , Caroline had less reason to be p@@ rou@@ d of her s@@ ons .
Some back@@ ben@@ ch@@ ers focus entirely on Parliament .
And it doesn 't take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
P@@ arti@@ cu@@ lar@@ ly if it is at the end of the Parliament or at the end of the Parliamentary year time is aga@@ in@@ st the government , so we can use that time to pres@@ su@@ ri@@ se the Minist@@ ers to think very car@@ ef@@ ully about what they are doing .
And other times she wouldn 't be fast enough , so she 'd be run@@ ning and run@@ ning , and she wouldn 't get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mi@@ ss it and she said it would continu@@ e on across the lan@@ d@@ s@@ ca@@ pe ,
And these are exam@@ ples of ans@@ w@@ ers that min@@ ist@@ ers have given back to me .
And that is , there are mir@@ ror neurons , just as there are mir@@ ror neurons for ac@@ tion , there are mir@@ ror neurons for tou@@ ch .
And by de@@ fin@@ i@@ tion , these s@@ mal@@ le@@ st numbers are always prime numbers .
But if you ask about their education , they p@@ in you to the w@@ all .
Ever@@ ybody knows , who 's expe@@ cting that E@@ . Chop@@ in didn 't want to re@@ ach the E there , because what will have happened ? It will be over , like Ham@@ let .

- It is a wi@@ c@@ ked wa@@ st@@ e .
As the baby he@@ ars a word in her language , the a@@ udi@@ tor@@ y areas light up , and then sub@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ tly areas sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ding it that we think are rela@@ ted to co@@ her@@ ence , getting the brain co@@ ordin@@ ated with its different areas , and ca@@ u@@ sa@@ li@@ ty , one brain are@@ a ca@@ using another to acti@@ v@@ ate .
This has to be trans@@ for@@ med into something else .
So , it 's a nor@@ mal@@ - looking sy@@ rin@@ ge . You lo@@ ad it up in the nor@@ mal way .
But how do they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te this c@@ ru@@ cial role and how much influence do they have ?
So , we got the whole ther@@ mod@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs de@@ par@@ t@@ ment at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d inv@@ olved -- a lot of com@@ pu@@ ta@@ tional f@@ lu@@ id d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs .
The idea is actually pretty simple .

What it de@@ mon@@ st@@ rat@@ ed is that babies take statistics on a new language .

We 've got four plan@@ ts .
We 're seeing the baby brain .
They create the Com@@ mitte@@ e of P@@ u@@ b@@ lic S@@ a@@ fe@@ ty , which sounds like a very nice committee .

I know exactly what you mean .
No d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , something f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating was happening then , which the Ameri@@ c@@ ans am@@ ong us will be aw@@ are of .
It doesn 't look like this ; it really looks more like this .

And then again in the House of Commons , which would be said by all MPs , that they are elected and so have the man@@ da@@ te to represent the w@@ ish@@ es , to some ex@@ tent , of their constituents .
It prof@@ oun@@ dly al@@ ter@@ ed my life in ways I didn 't expect in all the ways I just shar@@ ed with you .
And it comes from si@@ tu@@ ations like this where you have ei@@ ther s@@ kil@@ led or un@@ s@@ kil@@ led pra@@ cti@@ tion@@ ers , b@@ lin@@ dly giving an in@@ jec@@ tion to someone .
But then I re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed Tom talking to the open a@@ ir and I tried it .
There was a story I wouldn 't tell you then .

And it 's like the tra@@ f@@ fic that you see . The a@@ maz@@ ing thing about the c@@ ell is that it actually does ma@@ in@@ tain a fair@@ ly st@@ able working rela@@ tion@@ ship with other cel@@ ls , but we don 't know why .

( Music )
S@@ e@@ e , these are to@@ tally different worl@@ ds .
So we need a better produ@@ ct . And we need better information .
And in the end , quite often , the ur@@ ge is st@@ ron@@ ger than they are and they b@@ l@@ ur@@ t it out :
It 's good to start with some exam@@ ples .
If you haven 't like , you would not even look at them like ye@@ ster@@ day !
M@@ o@@ st of the important and all of the creative work in this are@@ a is being fun@@ ded by pri@@ v@@ ate p@@ hi@@ lan@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ es .
" How many prime numbers are there ? - and how big do they get ? "

And he poin@@ ted up to the sk@@ y , and he said ,
It 's a sp@@ len@@ did fi@@ sh , Ge@@ or@@ ge .
And it re@@ sts on a complexity , which has some charac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs very different from those that my fri@@ end
So that 's the next lay@@ er of simplicity , and , in fact , in@@ te@@ g@@ rat@@ ed circu@@ its are really simple in the sense that they , in general , work really well .

I don 't have to say , " I 'm a computer sci@@ enti@@ st . "

And there is this idea that the ap@@ es some@@ how changed into a human being . and I 've seen this in multi@@ ple con@@ tex@@ ts and even inside of bi@@ olo@@ gy class@@ es and even in the sci@@ enti@@ fic com@@ mun@@ ity they 'll say : oh the ap@@ e ev@@ olved into the human or the ap@@ e ev@@ olved into the pre@@ - human : the guy that almost st@@ o@@ od up@@ right , you know , the guy that was a little bit hun@@ ched back , he looked a little bit like an ap@@ e and a little bit like a human and so on and so for@@ th . And I want to be very cle@@ ar here :
O@@ n S@@ am@@ ha@@ in , the vil@@ la@@ g@@ ers ga@@ ther@@ ed and lit huge b@@ on@@ fi@@ res to dri@@ ve the de@@ ad back to the spi@@ ri@@ t world and keep them away from the living .
Be@@ fore I dis@@ cover@@ ed the won@@ d@@ ers of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of po@@ or far@@ m@@ ers . Li@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ iz@@ e .

The reali@@ ty , un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a la@@ ck of it .

It de@@ pen@@ ds how you de@@ f@@ ine lobbying .

So let 's just do this top part right here .

It 's not in@@ ten@@ ded that you read it , but that 's a tin@@ y part of the che@@ mi@@ cal re@@ ac@@ tions going on in each of your cel@@ ls at any given moment .

He said , " He was in a ca@@ r w@@ re@@ ck , and I pul@@ led him out , ga@@ ve him C@@ P@@ R , and I sa@@ ved his wife 's life as well . "
One of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es is what happened a few months ago when there was a g@@ as sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta .
And that inde@@ pen@@ dence and that political im@@ parti@@ ality is actually ab@@ solu@@ tely cen@@ tra@@ l to everything that we do .
It 's not only pre@@ ven@@ table ; it 's actually re@@ versi@@ ble .
WK :
Now is my book the next great American no@@ vel ?
And I want to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce a word that I think is very u@@ se@@ ful , which is st@@ ac@@ king . And I 'm going to use st@@ ac@@ king for a kind of simplicity that has the charac@@ teri@@ stic that it is so simple and so re@@ li@@ able that I can build things with it .
And it in@@ di@@ c@@ ates the whole stru@@ cture of education is shi@@ f@@ ting ben@@ eat@@ h our fe@@ et .
We started R@@ & am@@ p@@ ; D in 200@@ 6 .
In terms of Parliamentary acti@@ vity , there are of course all the fron@@ t@@ line ser@@ vi@@ ces like the chamber itself ; the ad@@ vice which is given by the cha@@ ir to all Members , Government or opposition , from the c@@ ler@@ ks at the table dre@@ ssed as I am now but with a wi@@ g and a go@@ wn on .
Parliament is ri@@ ch in history and its continu@@ ity has been a great st@@ ren@@ g@@ th but how does that we@@ ight of history im@@ pac@@ t the way Parliament condu@@ cts its af@@ fair@@ s in the 2@@ 1@@ st century ?
W@@ ha@@ tever our in@@ come , my Emily will spend it .
I thought this was un@@ accep@@ table .
The ti@@ cke@@ ts cost $@@ 29 each .
I didn 't think I 'd make it . "
So we 've sp@@ lit it into two groups of nine .
I took the En@@ er@@ gy bill through the House of Lords , and a number of amend@@ ments I pro@@ posed were not accep@@ ted by the Government . But they thought about it and come back later and changed their own bill .
What you 're seeing here is , we 've sel@@ ec@@ ted the pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain of a ch@@ ron@@ ic pain p@@ ati@@ ent .
Li@@ ke re@@ ligi@@ on , and money and other things .
It em@@ er@@ ges from our underst@@ anding of basi@@ c ne@@ uro@@ science .
They have become fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of being wrong .

And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen .
The min@@ ist@@ er of education down s@@ outh in London de@@ sc@@ rib@@ ed h@@ im@@ self as a " big f@@ an . "
But I 'm here to say , as a prof@@ ess@@ or of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a con@@ sci@@ ous , me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful way , in their day@@ - to- day lives .
I 've seen this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and over and over again .
Let 's go there and make love .
You say , " OK , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ,

" Evan Willi@@ ams . "
And they 're d@@ run@@ k !
But , you know , we have become ob@@ ses@@ sed with this lin@@ e@@ ar nar@@ ra@@ tive .
So I made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody .
But the rela@@ tion@@ ship is there in this bi@@ - c@@ am@@ er@@ al Parliament , and this is how it should be .
So he starts to feel all of that old an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty start to ri@@ se in him like , " I 'm going to lo@@ se this thing , and I 'll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g for@@ ever .

So now , you 're going to follow the line all the way from B to E@@ .
B@@ ea@@ u@@ ty , was inde@@ ed very beautiful .
And here , once again , we can use -- you could call it a tri@@ ck , but hop@@ ef@@ ully , you understand why it works .
So , you have a p@@ ati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . If the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom .
So this one would have to be big@@ ger ?
In Ma@@ la@@ w@@ i , K@@ as@@ un@@ gu .
We want to play you one more selection .
S@@ tor@@ m cha@@ sing is a very ta@@ cti@@ le experience .
What , to power -- for li@@ gh@@ ting and stuff ?
You all are ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed to having your cel@@ l@@ ph@@ ones work the large maj@@ ority of the time .
In the old days the House of Lords was as powerful as the House of Commons .
( Laughter )
But throu@@ gh@@ out history there have been peri@@ ods of con@@ fli@@ ct where the King as@@ ser@@ ted the div@@ ine right of K@@ ings to ru@@ le , and Parliament re@@ sist@@ ed ; and so during the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar con@@ fli@@ ct , this was res@@ olved in fav@@ our of Parliament .
It is this fe@@ eling that has b@@ rou@@ ght you to me .
Okay , so there is a feedback sig@@ nal that ve@@ to@@ es the sig@@ nal of the mir@@ ror neuron pre@@ ven@@ ting you from con@@ sci@@ ously experi@@ en@@ cing that tou@@ ch .
L@@ un@@ ch ? No , he was thinking about the vi@@ sion for S@@ outh Afri@@ ca and for human beings . This is about vi@@ sion .
So every possible number has one - and only one - prime fac@@ tor@@ iz@@ ation .
Ta@@ ke the red p@@ ill , you st@@ ay in wonder@@ la@@ nd and I show you how de@@ ep the ra@@ b@@ bit h@@ ole goes .
So let 's just run through these gu@@ ys .
The development of Parliament and Parliamentary in@@ stitu@@ tions was really charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by a cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es@@  long bat@@ t@@ le between the ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive , in the sha@@ pe of the King , and the represen@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of the people , ini@@ tially of course on an incre@@ di@@ bly nar@@ row f@@ ran@@ chi@@ se , which was wi@@ den@@ ed in the 19@@ th century and then wi@@ den@@ ed again sub@@ stan@@ tially in the 20@@ th C@@ en@@ tury .
And he pro@@ posed this ma@@ ch@@ ine called the me@@ me@@ x .
Because for me , to jo@@ in the B to the E , I have to stop thinking about every single no@@ te along the way , and start thinking about the long , long line from B to E@@ .
And once you get over the back@@ h@@ and@@ ed natu@@ re of that , there was actually something very prof@@ ound there .
So he 'll see every as@@ pe@@ ct of the re@@ ac@@ tion : the fact that B@@ ar@@ ac@@ k O@@ b@@ am@@ a is the big@@ ge@@ st Twitter@@ er , the fact that it came out of TED .
T@@ hat@@  is our big power , our power of de@@ lay .
( Laughter ) R@@ ight .
It 's a tech@@ ni@@ cal t@@ our de for@@ ce .
( Laughter ) People wer@@ en 't aw@@ are they could have that .
( Laughter )
It 's very hard to know , by the way , what it is you take for gran@@ ted .
It is not the Qu@@ een '@@ s ad@@ dre@@ ss , it is the Go@@ vern@@ men@@ t 's ad@@ dre@@ ss , it is the Go@@ vern@@ men@@ t 's legisla@@ tive progra@@ m@@ me that is en@@ un@@ ci@@ ated there .
He said , " I think he thin@@ ks better of me now . "
We don 't build this produ@@ ction equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment any longer in the U@@ . S@@ . , un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely .
No two lo@@ cks share a ke@@ y .
And I want to thank all of you in the a@@ udience for being great husb@@ an@@ ds , great mo@@ thers , friends , da@@ ugh@@ ters , s@@ ons .
When I ar@@ ri@@ ved in L@@ . A@@ . about nine years ago ,
And it 's because I 'm giving you cri@@ tical data about me .
Why is i@@ mi@@ tation important ?
They were s@@ ent down to find if there was any opport@@ un@@ ity for sel@@ ling sho@@ es , and they w@@ ro@@ te tel@@ e@@ gra@@ ms back to M@@ an@@ ch@@ est@@ er .
But we as adul@@ ts are no longer ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing those statistics .
So if we rou@@ nd 42 to the ne@@ ar@@ est ten -- we 've done this dri@@ ll many times -- 2 in the ones place is the less than 5 , so we 're going to rou@@ nd down .
Now , one re@@ cent dis@@ co@@ very that has been made by re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in Par@@ ma , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o R@@ iz@@ z@@ ola@@ tti and his col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , is a group of neurons called mir@@ ror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ tal lob@@ es .
I do not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily a@@ gree with them but to me it@@  is very important that they understand , even though I may not share their vie@@ w@@ point , that I still represent them .
WK :
So the hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y is ro@@ o@@ ted on two ideas .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) ( Applause )
The system was de@@ sig@@ ned to au@@ g@@ ment human intellig@@ ence , it was called .
So , imagine you 're st@@ anding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in Ameri@@ ca and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says ,
If they want sa@@ d music , they just play those two no@@ tes .
But otherwise , you never hear it .
( Laughter )
But they took the th@@ r@@ one on the con@@ di@@ tion that they accep@@ ted what became the Bill of R@@ i@@ ghts , which as@@ ser@@ ted that the King could not legisla@@ te on his own .
Well , we heard that one too , but " Pi@@ one@@ er G@@ er@@ m F@@ i@@ gh@@ ters " to@@ tally r@@ ules .
They can bring forward a Pri@@ v@@ ate Member '@@ s Bill ; they can ask for issues to be dis@@ cu@@ ssed by way of an amend@@ ment .
" Al@@ ways . I 've always been a fi@@ re@@ man . "
All right , so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particu@@ lar kind .
( Applause )
So let me nar@@ row the cho@@ i@@ ces down to two .
Parliamentarians by lobbying for their point of view . Members of Parliament are elected to represent their local constituents .
The book had three , your@@ s had four .
I know a woman who 's good at this .

There was a guy called D@@ i@@ ck Ro@@ we who was at D@@ ec@@ ca R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
There was no ac@@ tive process going on , called evolution .
I sh@@ all be taking you there .
This is made on exist@@ ing equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment in 14 fac@@ t@@ ori@@ es that we li@@ cen@@ se .
And so you 're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to reali@@ ze this dre@@ am ?

The Government of the day dra@@ wn from the political party with the maj@@ ority of MPs after an elec@@ tion , or a co@@ ali@@ tion of par@@ ties , @@ se@@ eks to dri@@ ve the country forward using its own legisla@@ tive a@@ gen@@ da .
E@@ i@@ ther to just stop and give us more time to look at legislation or oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , particu@@ lar@@ ly if we are coming up to the end of the Parliamentary year or coming up to the end of the Parliament when there is going to be a general elec@@ tion , in those circum@@ stances the House of Lords can say ; han@@ g on , we do not think yo@@ u@@  have got this quite right , we want you to think aga@@ in@@  .
This was the love of his life , Sarah .
The big power that we have in the House of Lords is really to make the government think again .

And doing that , I think , is the answer to the future because it 's not about scal@@ ing a new s@@ olution ; it 's about cre@@ ating a movement in education in which people devel@@ op their own solu@@ tions , but with ex@@ ter@@ nal support based on a person@@ ali@@ zed cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .

But perhaps where that f@@ al@@ ls down is that , in most c@@ ases , the Government whi@@ ps wil@@ l@@  not want to see too many changes to their bil@@ ls .
I wanted to vo@@ mit .
I think the st@@ ren@@ g@@ ths of U@@ K Parliamentary system , and I w@@ ou@@ l@@ @@ d almost answer this in the same bre@@ ath as @@ what are the we@@ ak@@ nes@@ ses , the real answer is that the system is as effec@@ tive as its Members want to make it .

It 's important to show not just the lead@@ er , but the follo@@ w@@ ers , because you find that new follo@@ w@@ ers e@@ mu@@ late the follo@@ w@@ ers , not the lead@@ er .
No . And we 'll make our@@ selves wrong and o@@ thers wrong .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence is that many high@@ l@@ y@@ - tal@@ en@@ ted , b@@ ri@@ lli@@ ant , creative people think they 're not , because the thing they were good at at school wasn 't valu@@ ed , or was actually sti@@ g@@ ma@@ tiz@@ ed .
So , as we 're told that we should all be lead@@ ers , that would be really in@@ effec@@ tive .
This was part of a challen@@ ge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years .

And the reason so many people are op@@ ting out of education is because it doesn 't fe@@ ed their spi@@ ri@@ t , it doesn 't fe@@ ed their energy or their pas@@ sion .
We need to radi@@ cally re@@ think our view of intellig@@ ence .
What kind of school would have the te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers fi@@ gh@@ ting to get in , not fi@@ gh@@ ting to st@@ ay out ?
I see some of you recogni@@ ze this child .

There are now do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ ani@@ es that de@@ p@@ end up@@ on lobbying for their very exist@@ ence .

But then he got ol@@ der , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was dri@@ ving down the fre@@ e@@ way in Los An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all changed for him .

He doesn 't have a piece of pa@@ per , or a pen@@ ci@@ l , or a ta@@ pe recor@@ der .
We have committee work which means that every single la@@ w is looked at in en@@ or@@ m@@ ous detail ; every line , every com@@ ma is looked at .
Well , coming out of the re@@ search lab@@ s just now , for our gener@@ ation , is the possi@@ bility to do that .

And as long as the elected chamber has the last word , even if it@@  is only after a year or so , then we feel that that ba@@ lan@@ ce is being pro@@ per@@ ly ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ed .

And let me just read it , the important deta@@ il@@ s here :

I use a lot of tri@@ cks , which means that sometimes I have to li@@ e to you .
My con@@ tention is that creativity now is as important in education as liter@@ ac@@ y , and we should tre@@ at it with the same st@@ at@@ us .
What are you wa@@ iting for ?
Parliamentarians by lobbying for their point of view . Members of Parliament are elected to represent their local constituents .
That 's God , you know .
So the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e c@@ up , or the c@@ up with a h@@ and@@ le , is one of the to@@ ols used by so@@ ci@@ e@@ ty to ma@@ in@@ tain public heal@@ th .
We create our lives sy@@ m@@ bioti@@ cally as we ex@@ pl@@ ore our tal@@ ents in rela@@ tion to the circum@@ stances they help to create for us .
So we consi@@ der@@ ed all of this . And we reali@@ zed that electri@@ cal appli@@ an@@ ces must be able to com@@ muni@@ c@@ ate dire@@ c@@ tly with the power re@@ cep@@ ta@@ cle itself .
If you work in education , you 're not asked . ( Laughter ) And you 're never asked back , cu@@ ri@@ ously .
But for the rest of my life , if I meet J@@ oh@@ n H@@ od@@ g@@ man at a TED party ,
What tru@@ th ?
But every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these perfor@@ m@@ ers would actually become trans@@ cen@@ dent . And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point in your life , a perfor@@ man@@ ce like this .
Parliamentarians , with their areas of exper@@ ti@@ se and interest , are the c@@ ru@@ cial ac@@ tors in this process as they scrutin@@ ise the work of the Government , represen@@ ting their party and constituents .
The uni@@ qu@@ e ke@@ y for each lo@@ ck would be its prime fac@@ tor@@ iz@@ ation .
There 's no magi@@ c ; it 's pra@@ cti@@ ce , pra@@ cti@@ ce , pra@@ cti@@ ce .
M@@ M :
This will give us the prime fac@@ tors .
Now , where 's the la@@ dy ?
What you see here looks nothing like an in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or .

Car@@ ol C@@ ol@@ et@@ ta says , " I would pay someone to do what I do . "

What we need -- and the word 's been used many times in the past few days -- is not evolution , but a re@@ v@@ olution in education .
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter .
R@@ a@@ ther than try to figu@@ re them out ,
We found some n@@ on- to@@ xi@@ c re@@ fri@@ ger@@ an@@ ts that worked at very low va@@ p@@ or pres@@ su@@ res .
" It was a cal@@ cu@@ la@@ ted move on the part of the Ch@@ ur@@ ch to bring more people into the f@@ old . "

But at the end of the day , when you have had this to- ing and fro@@ - ing and the impro@@ vement of legislation , the Commons has its say because the Commons is the su@@ pre@@ me au@@ th@@ ority ; it is the elected au@@ th@@ ority .
Yeah .

We are go@@ vern@@ ed by the represen@@ ta@@ tions in me@@ mor@@ y that were for@@ med ear@@ ly in development .
Now , one of the nice charac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of simple things is you know what it 's going to do , in general .
As a Sh@@ in@@ ne@@ co@@ ck In@@ di@@ an , I was ra@@ is@@ ed to know this .
That chor@@ d doesn 't work .

Here are three questions dra@@ wn from my work .
Some have . She 's a chor@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ her , and everybody knows her work .

En@@ g@@ lish has a lot of R@@ s and L@@ s . The distri@@ bu@@ tion sho@@ ws .
That 's six !
And em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers who ke@@ pt com@@ pla@@ ining that the kids coming out of school wer@@ en 't actually ready for real work , didn 't have the right at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and experience .

But one of the co@@ ol@@ est things in this book are the interac@@ tive in@@ fo@@ gra@@ p@@ hi@@ cs .

This is the pri@@ mar@@ y use we saw of Twitter from the be@@ gin@@ ning , and what got us exc@@ ited .
And yet we 're me@@ ant to be edu@@ c@@ ating them for it . So the un@@ predi@@ c@@ ta@@ bility , I think , is ex@@ tra@@ ordinary .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let 's put the individual human being at the cen@@ ter of the uni@@ ver@@ se a@@ bo@@ ve all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es , and there 's no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal cre@@ atu@@ res who take di@@ c@@ tation from the div@@ ine .
I was working with this young pi@@ ani@@ st , and said , " The trouble with you is you 're a tw@@ o@@ - bu@@ t@@ to@@ ck play@@ er .
Now you 've seen before that with elec@@ tro@@ des you can control ro@@ bo@@ tic ar@@ ms , that brain i@@ mag@@ ing and sc@@ an@@ n@@ ers can show you the in@@ si@@ des of bra@@ ins .
So I deci@@ ded I would build one win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll for myself .
And the reason is we were b@@ rou@@ ght up in a pre@@ - di@@ gi@@ tal cul@@ ture , those of us over 25 .

So there is change that is made there that comes from Parliament itself .

Con@@ stitu@@ ents seek to influence MPs by writing to their Members of Parliament on issues of im@@ portan@@ ce to them . They could be policy issues , not just about d@@ om@@ es@@ tic policy but con@@ cer@@ ns , for example , about what is happening in other parts of the world like the Mi@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st .
We 're gonna be together for@@ ever , right ?
She spoke from her co@@ f@@ f@@ in and made gh@@ ou@@ lish de@@ man@@ ds
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you gu@@ ys , you can go off and do all kin@@ ds of f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous things with it .
And we run our comp@@ ani@@ es like this .
He said , " It was hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ating .
But well , I 'm fe@@ eling good right now .
And high am@@ ong them is education , because education , in a way , dis@@ lo@@ c@@ ates very many people from their natural tal@@ ents .

I think it 's better if we en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge our great creative min@@ ds to live .

If they don 't know , they 'll have a go .
We 've col@@ lap@@ sed that through technology to milli@@ secon@@ ds , and that allo@@ ws us to let Pe@@ ter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the sc@@ an@@ ner .

We 've got the science , we 've had the de@@ b@@ ate .

And that inde@@ pen@@ dence and that political im@@ parti@@ ality is actually ab@@ solu@@ tely cen@@ tra@@ l to everything that we do .
You 'll e@@ at coun@@ t@@ less g@@ our@@ met me@@ als .
We can do that with our children , too . Wh@@ o am I being , that my children 's eyes are not sh@@ ining ?
So put your ar@@ ms back up and fle@@ x your bi@@ ce@@ p .

They can ring up MPs offi@@ ces and pas@@ s on their com@@ ments to a Member of Parliament before a c@@ ru@@ cial vo@@ te in the Commons .
It starts playing im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely .
At last . W@@ el@@ come Ne@@ o !
But they 're less likely to sti@@ ck .
It 's a way of getting their head to me@@ et@@ ings .
And h@@ ence they en@@ ded up in an or@@ ph@@ an@@ age .
We have 18 bo@@ x@@ es , and we want to divi@@ de them into two equ@@ als st@@ ac@@ ks , so we want to divi@@ de 18 by 2 .
At that point , they usu@@ ally give up .
And so when she came out of A@@ us@@ ch@@ wit@@ z , she made a vo@@ w .
People will say to you ,
Because -- ( Applause )
The role of the opposition , of course , is not always to op@@ pose .
There are great ones , like K@@ l@@ P@@ P 's ; it 's a great system .
Now that 's a great de@@ al of us , isn 't it ?
So let 's see what 's really going on here .
Of course in re@@ cent years we had a woman Pri@@ me Minist@@ er in Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher , so that was a dra@@ mati@@ c change , as have been the number of women Members of Parliament in the House of Commons .
WK :
Then all this money started p@@ our@@ ing in .
( Laughter )
And another way to think about it . Just say , well , you know , 42 , that 's pretty clo@@ se to 40 .
" I tried . And I made it . "
So we didn 't do it .
The important thing perhaps to remember in the House of Lords , un@@ like in the House of Commons , is that there is time to do this because we have no time li@@ mit on our debat@@ es .
Twitter was origin@@ ally de@@ sig@@ ned as a bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st medi@@ um : you sen@@ d one mes@@ sa@@ ge and it goes out to everybody , and you re@@ cei@@ ve the mes@@ sa@@ ges you 're interest@@ ed in .
I think you 'd have to con@@ c@@ lu@@ de , if you look at the out@@ put , who really suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ds by this , who does everything that they should , who gets all the bro@@ w@@ ni@@ e poin@@ ts , who are the win@@ n@@ ers --
In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot .
W@@ ow .
I don 't need to impro@@ ve any more . "
The fron@@ t@@ ben@@ ches are two s@@ word len@@ g@@ ths and a fo@@ ot away .
( Applause )
Now I feel ba@@ d about that .
W@@ ha@@ tever happens , don 't give up .
They can just watch those videos .
And they ta@@ pped into the fact that , if you have milli@@ ons of people around the world talking about what they 're doing and what 's around them , you have an incre@@ di@@ ble res@@ our@@ ce to find out about any top@@ ic or ev@@ ent while it 's going on .
Al@@ right , have a good tri@@ p .
But the point is that that ex@@ tra@@ ordinary simple idea re@@ sts on lay@@ ers of simplicity each comp@@ oun@@ ded into a complexity that is itself simple , in the sense that it is completely re@@ li@@ able .
One of the many ways that us@@ ers sha@@ ped the evolution of Twitter was by inven@@ ting a way to re@@ p@@ ly to a speci@@ fic person or a speci@@ fic mes@@ sa@@ ge .
Now you can cho@@ ose to re@@ du@@ ce your home energy bill by au@@ to@@ mati@@ cally cy@@ c@@ ling he@@ av@@ y lo@@ a@@ ds like a@@ ir con@@ di@@ tion@@ ers and he@@ at@@ ers .
So there are two things going on .

T@@ hat@@  is our big power , our power of de@@ lay .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you gu@@ ys all co@@ ol with that idea ? Are you com@@ for@@ table with that ? Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know --
What do you say ?
Just like yourself , love .
O@@ k O@@ k
And we have seen that in all political par@@ ties now .
I didn 't say , " I 'm going to move my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der over , move my body . "
Now in this room , there are people who represent ex@@ tra@@ ordinary resources in business , in multi@@ medi@@ a , in the Internet .
Я с@@ л@@ ы@@ ша@@ л , ч@@ то са@@ м@@ ы@@ й ж@@ ест@@ ки@@ й у@@ чи@@ те@@ л@@ ь - э@@ то у@@ чи@@ те@@ л@@ ь ру@@ с@@ с@@ ко@@ г@@ о
And we can see from the gra@@ p@@ h that ex@@ po@@ sure to En@@ g@@ lish didn 't impro@@ ve their Mandarin .
Now this is f@@ ine , up to a point .
And this whole book , it doesn 't just run on the i@@ P@@ ad . It also run@@ s on the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
( Laughter )
And the distri@@ bu@@ tion of J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese is to@@ tally different , where we see a group of inter@@ medi@@ ate sounds , which is known as the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese " R@@ . "
So there has to be function , the function has to be predi@@ c@@ table and the cost has to be low .
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les ne@@ ar Par@@ is in late N@@ ov@@ em@@ ber 19@@ 9@@ 0 .
M@@ r@@ . W@@ o@@ od@@ ru@@ ff 's go@@ al was to make ice c@@ old Coca- Cola a@@ va@@ ila@@ ble to an@@ yone , any@@ time , any@@ place .
So some@@ how I 'm gonna get my DNA to get enough changes to look more like this .
N@@ oti@@ ce , this is an al@@ de@@ hy@@ de , and it 's an al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
So that est@@ ab@@ lish@@ ed the su@@ pre@@ ma@@ cy of Parliament over the Mon@@ arch .
It 's by A@@ st@@ or Pi@@ a@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ la , an Ar@@ gen@@ t@@ ine com@@ po@@ ser .
And if you don 't know how , p@@ lea@@ se find me -- I will help you .
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
It 's been great , ha@@ s@@ n 't it ? I 've been blo@@ wn away by the whole thing .
But the process , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ xi@@ e@@ ty around it was re@@ le@@ ased when he took the geni@@ e , the geni@@ us out of him where it was ca@@ using nothing but trouble , and re@@ le@@ ased it back where it came from , and reali@@ zed that this didn 't have to be this inter@@ na@@ li@@ zed , tor@@ men@@ ted thing .
P@@ res@@ su@@ res for re@@ form come from all sor@@ ts of dire@@ ctions and it is con@@ stant ; why should not it be ?
I 'm going to tell you about that technology .
CA :
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Don 't you feel ?
We know three things about intellig@@ ence .
We must di@@ sen@@ th@@ r@@ all our@@ selves , and then we sh@@ all sa@@ ve our country . "
I b@@ ou@@ ght a fast ca@@ r .
How an@@ no@@ ying would that be ? ( Laughter ) " Mu@@ st try har@@ der . "
Your life will have new me@@ aning .
Gre@@ at creativity can turn a spo@@ t@@ light on de@@ pri@@ vation , or show that de@@ pri@@ vation a@@ in 't ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily so .
And it works the exac@@ t same way .
And the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that I recently w@@ ro@@ te this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called " E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , Lo@@ ve " which , deci@@ de@@ dly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vious books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ - sen@@ sa@@ tion , inter@@ nati@@ on@@ al be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler thing .
He said I was th@@ ro@@ wing my life away if that 's all I cho@@ se to do with it ; that I should go to colle@@ ge , I should become a profes@@ sion@@ al person , that I had great po@@ tenti@@ al and I was wa@@ st@@ ing my tal@@ ent to do that . "
Thank you . ( Applause ) Un@@ less we do something to pre@@ v@@ ent it , over the next 40 years we 're fac@@ ing an e@@ pi@@ demic of ne@@ uro@@ logi@@ c dise@@ ases on a glob@@ al scal@@ e .
And the arti@@ cle was called " As We M@@ ay Th@@ in@@ k . "
It is by shar@@ ing these mom@@ ents as they 're happening that le@@ ts people feel more conne@@ cted and in tou@@ ch , de@@ sp@@ ite di@@ stance , and in real time .
As this country changes over the years , so what people expect from their Parliament is changing .
( La@@ ugh@@ ing )

If you bur@@ n yourself , you pul@@ l your hand away .
In a world where the role of Parliam@@ ents will incre@@ ase , I believe that we have an interesting story to tell .
They can watch it at their own time , at their own pace . And probably the least app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated as@@ pe@@ ct of this is the no@@ tion that the very first time , the very first time that you 're trying to get your brain around a new concept , the very last thing you need is another human being saying , " Do you understand this ?

We were also playing with S@@ M@@ S at the time at O@@ de@@ o , so we kind of put two and two together , and in ear@@ ly 200@@ 6 we la@@ un@@ ched Twitter as a side pro@@ ject at O@@ de@@ o .

Do you know what I am talking about ?

If your job is to dance , do your dance .
So , let 's make it right in our own back@@ y@@ ard .
And in one gener@@ ation , for example ,
It is a very different system but we still dra@@ w a dist@@ in@@ ction because al@@ though the me@@ m@@ bers of Government are Members of Parliament ,
D@@ is@@ cu@@ ss .

I was here .
The first is that the babies are list@@ ening in@@ ten@@ tly to us , and they 're taking statistics as they list@@ en to us talk -- they 're taking statistics .
There is a very cle@@ ar dist@@ in@@ ction between Parliament and Government ; not as cle@@ ar ho@@ we@@ ver as in the United St@@ ates .
But then , if you know everything you can know about those two things , and you put them together , what can you say about this com@@ bin@@ ation ?
One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a one- way stre@@ et .
How do we condu@@ ct our Parliamentary af@@ fair@@ s and the business of la@@ w@@ - making ?

When I first en@@ ter@@ ed Parliament in 19@@ 70 , I would not say that lobbying was in its inf@@ an@@ cy because lobbying goes back to the 19@@ th C@@ en@@ tury and before , but there was less organ@@ is@@ ed lobbying .
If you said , " Don 't do this any@@ more , " they 'd won@@ der what you 're talking about .

It didn 't help .
Now before we ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate it , they say find the value of the ex@@ pre@@ ssi@@ on .

Let 's make that one of the groups , and let 's making these bot@@ tom ones another group .
( Laughter ) It 's the same ge@@ stu@@ re he makes when he comes home after a long day , turns off the ke@@ y in his ca@@ r and says , " A@@ ah , I 'm home . "
" P@@ er@@ sist@@ ence is the number one reason for our success . "
And I think , if I can just bor@@ row this c@@ am@@ er@@ a , I was going to show you my inven@@ tion , which I came up with .
And it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very , very simple idea about tur@@ ning education on its head and pu@@ tting the things which were mar@@ gin@@ al , things like working in te@@ ams , doing pra@@ c@@ tical pro@@ jec@@ ts , and pu@@ tting them right at the heart of learning , rather than on the ed@@ ges .
People have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years .
